<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>


<p><i>Girl Scouting has a double meaning. To some it means
the fun of playing the games of the Girl Scouts; to
others, the fun of “playing the game” in Scouting Girls.
Our desire in producing this Scout scheme is to offer
help to parents, teachers, and patriots who may care to
avail themselves of it when it comes to the duty of training
girls.</i></p>

<p><i>The object of the Scout training is to give our girls,
whatever may be their circumstances, a series of healthy
and jolly activities which, while delighting them, will afford
them a course of education outside the school in
four particular lines of which there is the greatest need:</i></p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>1. <i>CHARACTER AND INTELLIGENCE, through
games, practices and activities, and honours and
tests for promotion.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>SKILL AND HANDCRAFT, encouraged through
badges for proficiency.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>SERVICE FOR OTHERS and FELLOWSHIP,
through daily good turns, organised public service,
etc.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>PHYSICAL HEALTH and HYGIENE, through
development up to standard by games and exercises
designed for the purpose.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span><i>I have ventured to describe the above as a course of</i>
education <i>instead of a course of</i> instruction <i>since the
girls are led to learn of their own desire—which is education—instead
of having the knowledge impressed upon
them from outside—which is instruction</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Scouts are divided into four grades, to each of
which a corresponding Part of this book applies:</i>—</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="levels of scouting">
<tr><td align="left"><i>PART I.</i></td><td align="left"><i>Brownies, under 11.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><i>PART II.</i></td><td align="left"><i>Scouts, 11 to 16.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><i>PART III.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left"><i>Senior Scouts, over 16.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><i>PART IV.</i></td><td align="left"><i>Scouts, 18 to 81.</i></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><i>The latter are what would otherwise be termed officers,
but their position is rather that of elder sisters reviving
their youth by playing among and leading the girls than
of officers ordering them about, or repressing them.</i></p>

<p><i>In each grade the training runs on the same four lines
as that shown on the preceding paragraph, but on relatively
higher standards at each stage, according to the
psychology of the girl concerned in it.</i></p>

<p><i>Experience has shown that the scheme is easily applicable,
even by untrained leaders, to all kinds of girls,
whether in town or country, at home or overseas; and
that it is capable of bringing about most satisfactory
results.</i></p>

<p><i>This book merely offers an outline of principles, together
with a few samples of details as an indication to
guiders of the lines on which they can carry out the training.
Further details are largely left to their own ingenuity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
to devise, according to the condition and character
of their girls and of their surroundings.</i></p>

<p><i>In any case the programme of the training should be
kept as unlike a school syllabus as possible in order to
give it novelty and freshness.</i></p>

<p><i>The book is worded in such a way that it can be studied
by the girls themselves in the different grades. The
paragraphs in italics are more particularly addressed to
the Scouters. In conjunction with this book the Book of
Rules of the Association should be read, and where there
may be any difference in detail between the two the Book
of Rules should be taken as the guide, being more frequently
under revision and, therefore, up to date; and
also the monthly</i> <span class="smcap">Girl Scouts’ Gazette</span>.</p>

<p><i>For further suggestions on the work of Scouters and
their aims and methods see Part IV. Perhaps the most
important suggestion that I can offer here to Scouters
may be summed up in the motto:</i>—</p>

<small>BROWNIES</small></h2>

<img src="images/i_007.jpg" width="224" height="318" alt="drawing of brownie dancing on mushroom shaped thing" />
<div class="caption">The Brownies’ Totem.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A Brownie</span> is a household fairy who lives under and
in the trees. This is the reason that the Brownies badge
is an acorn.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of
Brownies, such as Sprites, Elves,
Gnomes, Fairies, Goblins, Pixies,
Imps, Nymphs, Will-o’-the-wisps.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a fairy
ring? There are many in the
woods and sometimes in the garden—just
a wide circle in the
ground of rather darker grass
than the rest of the turf round
about it. It is said to be a track
made by the Brownies who come
together and dance on the grass
by moonlight, round a toadstool in the middle.</p>

<p>So our Brownies have a toadstool as their Totem and
they make their ring around it. Like true fairies they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
can make their ring anywhere, not only in the woods or
out on the grass, but even in the town and in a room.</p>

<p>When they come together they plant the toadstool in
the center and the Brownie captain (that is, the leader of
the Pack) takes her place by the toadstool. The Brownies
then form a ring around her, the Elves together (there
must not be more than eight of them), the Goblins together,
the Fairies together, and so on.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 93px;">
<img src="images/i_008a.jpg" width="93" height="93" alt="circle iwth dot in center" />
</div>

<p>For the Pow-wow (or Talking Ring) they stand close
together, so that their elbows are touching. It is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the Pow-wow Ring, or Talking Ring, because they can
hear the voice and the wise words of the Captain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 568px;">
<img src="images/i_008b.jpg" width="568" height="372" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">The Fairy Ring.</div>
</div>

<p>For the Dancing Ring they all join hands, and make
the circle as wide as they can reach.</p>


<h3>The Promise</h3>

<p>Any girl can become a Brownie who is under ten, and
who does her best to carry out the Promise of the
Brownies.</p>

<p>This is the Promise:</p>


<ul class="smallin">
<li>1. To be obedient.</li>
<li>2. To help other people, especially those at home.</li>
</ul>



<h3>The Recruit Brownie</h3>

<p>When a girl first joins the Brownies she is only a
recruit like a boy who joins the army, and before she can
count as a real Brownie she must know and understand
the Promise, and what is more she must have carried it
out by doing a good turn in her own home.</p>



<h3>The Pack</h3>

<p>The Goblins go together, the Fairies go together and
so on, each forming a Pack. Some Packs are numbered
like Girl Scout troops instead of being named Fairy,
Pixie, Elf, etc.</p>



<h3>The Eight</h3>

<p>The Captain or Leader of a pack is a grown-up person,
and in each pack there are several parties of eight under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
a Leader who is selected if possible from a Girl Scout
Patrol, and who is called a Brownie Lieutenant.</p>



<h3>Badge</h3>

<p>Each Brownie Pack selects the leaf of any tree for its
crest. This may be a real leaf or any artificial one.</p>

<ul class="normal"><li>LIST OF TREES</li>
<li>Oak</li>
<li>Sycamore</li>
<li>Elm</li>
<li>Maple</li>
<li>Pine</li>
<li>Ash</li>
<li>Chestnut</li>

<li>Spruce</li>

</ul>



<h3>Motto</h3>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Be Prepared.</span></div>

<p>The Yell or Cry: LAH, LAH, LAH. It sounds nonsense
but it is not, because it means Lend a Hand, and
LAH are the initials.</p>

<h3>Tests</h3>

<h4>The Recruit</h4>

<p>A Brownie must know:</p>


<ul class="smallin"><li>The Brownie’s Promise.</li>
<li>The Salute.</li>
<li>The Good Turn.</li>
<li>The Motto.</li>
</ul>

<p class="unindent">and must be able to:</p>

<ul class="smallin"><li>Tie her hair ribbon.</li>
<li>Wash dishes properly.</li>
<li>Know how to sit tall.</li></ul>


<h4>To be Obedient</h4>

<p>In the Brownie Pack every Brownie obeys the wishes
of the leader. So it is in our nation. The Americans
are a very big pack, but they have their one chief, the
President. To be successful as an army in a battle or as
the team in a football match all should obey their captain.
If everybody started to play the game in his own
way, there would be confusion, and there could be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
results. But if we “play the game” according to orders
our country will always be successful.</p>

<p>And in the same way, as a Brownie you must obey
the Lieutenant of your Eight.</p>


<h4>The Good Turn</h4>

<p>But now about the second promise, namely, to do a
good turn to somebody every day.</p>

<p>The Brownies and the Girl Scouts have a patent dodge
of making themselves happy. How do you suppose they
do it?</p>

<p>By running about and playing at scouting games? By
going out into camp? By lighting fires and cooking their
own grub? By tracking down animals, and getting to
know all about their ways?</p>

<p>Yes, they do all these things, and make themselves
happy; but they have a still better way than that. It
is very simple. They do it by making other people
happy.</p>

<p>That is to say, every day they do a kindness to some
one. It does not matter who the person is (so long as
it is not themselves), friend or stranger, man or woman,
or child.</p>

<p>And the kindness, or “good turn,” need not be a big
thing. You can generally get a chance of doing a little
kindness in your own home, such as helping your mother
or a servant to do some little job about the house; or
you can, if away from home, help an old lady to carry
her parcel, or take a little child safely across the street,
or do something of that sort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>But whatever you do, you must not take any reward
for doing it. If you take money for it, it is not a good
turn, but just a piece of work that has been paid for.</p>


<h4>The Brownies’ Smile</h4>

<p>Brownies always smile, and if they are in difficulty,
in pain, in trouble, or in danger, they don’t cry, they just
grin and bear it.</p>



<h3>The Salute</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 129px;">
<img src="images/i_013.jpg" width="129" height="384" alt="Brownie saluting with both hands on either side of temples" />
<div class="caption">How to salute.</div>
</div>

<p>When a Brownie shakes hands with another Brownie,
or with a Girl Scout or Boy Scout, she does so with the
left hand. That is the secret sign of
brotherhood between them all.</p>

<p>Then also as a Brownie <i>you</i> must understand
and be able to make the salute, which
is done by holding up your hand with two
fingers like this:</p>



<p>The Salute is another sign that you are
a Brownie, even though you may not be
dressed in uniform, and that you recognize
the person you are saluting also as a
Brownie.</p>



<h3>Investiture of a Brownie</h3>

<p>When a girl has passed her test as a
recruit she is admitted into her Eight as a
Brownie, and she can then go on and pass
her tests for a Second Class Brownie.</p>

<p>The pack is formed up in the dancing ring, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
recruits stand in the Pow-wow circle, with the Brownie
Captain in the center.</p>

<p>The Brownie Captain says to the Recruit: “You
have learnt what the Brownies are, and how they owe
their duty to be obedient, to help other people, especially
their own family, every day. What have you done to
help in your home?”</p>

<p>When the recruit has answered, the Brownie Captain
again asks: “What is your motto as a Brownie?”</p>

<p>“Be prepared.”</p>

<p>“Do you know that if you now make the Promise you
must always stick to it afterwards and do your best to
carry it out? So do you still wish to make it?” If the
recruit is willing the Brownie Captain then says: “Come
to the Totem Pole and repeat your promise as a
Brownie.”</p>

<p>The recruit, touching the Totem Pole with her left
hand, and with her right at the salute, then repeats the
Brownie Promise. The Brownie Captain then pins on her
left breast the badge of her Eight, and says: “You are
now a Brownie, and wear the badge of the Eight. Will
you promise to try?”</p>

<p>The Brownie Captain then shakes hands, left handed
with the Brownie. The Brownie salutes with her right
hand, faces about and salutes the Pack, and then runs to
join her Eight. Her Eight all shakes hands with her,
left-handed, to welcome her into the Eight.</p>

<h4>Tying up a Parcel</h4>

<p>The first duty of a parcel is to be neatly and strongly
tied up so that it does not come unfastened, but, poor
thing, it cannot do this for itself, so you have to do it a
good turn by tying it up. Wrap it neatly in strong paper.</p>

<p>Just as you tuck in the corners of the blankets on your
bed to keep you warm and snug, so the corners of the
paper should be tidily folded at the ends of a parcel and
doubled over flat.</p>

<p>The string should be drawn quite tight, and have only
small knots which won’t slip. It is therefore most important
that you should learn, as Scouts do, how to tie
knots properly.</p>

<p>When a parcel is going by post it gets thrown around
a good deal and has to stand a lot of banging about, so
bear that in mind when you are tying it up.</p>

<p>It is always wisest to write the name and address of
the person to whom you are sending the parcel on the
parcel itself. Very often people write this only on labels
which they tie on, and then if this label gets torn off at
all, away goes the parcel to the dead letter office or gets
quite lost.</p>


<h4>Hemming a Handkerchief</h4>

<p>Double the edges twice, so that the rough edge of the
square of linen or muslin are well inside the turning.
Then baste all around so as to hold the turned edges in
place, and so that they are the same width all round.</p>

<p>Then hem it with neat, small stitches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>


<h4>Darning Stockings</h4>

<p>You can do many a good turn by darning.</p>

<p>Mind you get wool or thread the same color, and if
possible of the same thickness as the threads of the stockings
you are going to darn.</p>

<p>You should put in your needle about an inch from the
actual hole, and push it up and down in straight lines,
taking a thread and missing a thread.</p>

<p>Then repeat this again criss-cross, leaving loops of the
wool where you turn, so that the new wool can shrink
without tearing the stocking when washed.</p>


<h4>Setting a Table</h4>

<p>Spread the table-cloth smoothly and evenly.</p>

<p>Put the knives, spoons, forks, and other things also
exactly in place, but before putting them there see that
there is not a speck of dirt on them, no finger marks or
dust.</p>

<p>Although there is a regular way of setting a table, and
all tables look much alike when set, there is a great difference
between one by a Scout and set by any other
girl. The Scout thinks for herself what things will be
needed for the meal, how many courses there will be, and
therefore how many knives, forks, and spoons, whether
pepper will be wanted or sugar, and puts them on the
table accordingly. She uses her wits as well as her hands.</p>


<h4>Binding up a Finger or Knee</h4>

<p><i>A cut on the hand.</i> If anybody cuts his hand, and it is
your job to render first aid, the first thing to think about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
is how to stop the bleeding. Remember, that just as important
as stopping the bleeding is the keeping of any
sort of dirt from getting near the wound. Now dirt
here does not mean what you generally call dirt—mud
and dust: it means anything containing germs. Germs
are tiny little insects, so small that your eye can’t see
them; if they get into a cut they may poison it so that it
festers and becomes really dangerous, ending, possibly, in
the loss of a finger or hand. The worst kind of germs
are those that come out of earth—such as garden mold,
or mud from the road. They cause a terrible disease
known as lock-jaw, so great care should be taken if any
one gets a deep cut while gardening, for instance. But
any dust, or any soiled object may, and does, contain
germs. So if you are about to bandage a cut, find the
very cleanest thing you can think of to put next to the
wound. The inside part of a clean, folded handkerchief
would probably be the best you could do, or failing this
the inside of a clean sheet of notepaper, or the inside
of an envelope. Having put something clean over the
wound, you must add padding of some sort—several
handkerchiefs or pieces of rag. Then bind up very firmly
with tight, even pressure so as to stop the bleeding.</p>

<p>You can do this with strips of rag or a large, folded
handkerchief. Make the patient keep his hand raised,
or put it in a sling, which you can make from a scarf if
you have one. Remember that your help is only first aid:
so take the patient to a grown-up person who will attend
to the wound more thoroughly, or take him to a doctor
to be stitched up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A graze.</i> A graze is a bad scrape which has taken the
skin off, and is usually covered with dirt—grit off the
road, and so on. It will not be bleeding much, as a rule.
The treatment should be to wash it well with clean warm
water, soaking it till the dirt comes away, and clean it
with little swabs of wool or cloth. When all the grit is
removed cover the graze with a clean piece of rag.
Bandage firmly, but not tight enough to be uncomfortable.</p>


<h3>Nails</h3>

<p>In the Japanese army, where soldiers keep themselves
very clean, they have the order that before eating a meal
they must always wash their hands, and they must at no
time allow their nails to be dirty. It is believed that it
is this rule which has prevented a great deal of illness
among the soldiers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 279px;">
<img src="images/i_019.jpg" width="279" height="116" alt="Two toes" />
<div class="caption">Toe-nail cutting.<br />
Right.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Wrong.</div>
</div>

<p>The reason for it is that these poisonous little germs,
which float about in the air, live on dirt and are very liable
to get on to your hands and to hide under your fingernails,
therefore you should always be careful to keep
these clean, especially before handling your food. Nails,
both on fingers and toes, should be kept properly trimmed
with scissors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Soldiers as well as other people, very often suffer
lameness and great pain from the nail of their big toe
growing down into the toe at one side.</p>


<h3>Toe-nail Cutting</h3>

<p>This is often caused by letting the nail grow too long
until by the pressure of the shoe, it is driven to grow
sideways into the toe. So you should be careful to cut
your toe-nails frequently every week or ten days, and
they should be cut square across the top, not rounded,
and with sharp scissors.</p>

<p>Finger nails should also be cut about once a week to
keep them in good order. They can be rounded to the
shape of the finger to prevent the corners catching and
getting torn.</p>

<p>Biting the nails is very bad for them.</p>


<h3>Teeth</h3>

<p>There is no part of you that poisonous germs attack
more readily than your teeth. They get in between them
and burrow inside them, and bring about that awful pain
known as toothache, and the teeth decay and have to be
pulled out; and consequently your food after that does
not get properly chewed.</p>

<p>But you can prevent this for yourself if you take the
trouble to clean your teeth properly, and to brush and
wash away these germs out of your mouth.</p>

<p>The first thing is to have a toothbrush. This you can
buy for a few cents at any drugstore. If you cannot afford
to buy one you can at any rate make one for yourself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
There are no drug stores in the wilds of Africa,
and yet the natives there have splendid teeth, and they
keep them clean by continually brushing them after every
meal with little brushes made out of bits of stick.</p>

<p>They take a short stick and hammer the end of it until
it is all frayed out like a paint brush. It is a brush that
any Brownie can make for herself in a few minutes. The
thing is not to forget to use it every morning and every
evening, when you get up and before going to bed, and
also if possible after your midday meal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 591px;">
<img src="images/i_021.jpg" width="591" height="138" alt="frayed stick" />
</div>

<p>Attack those germs with a brush and get them out
from their hiding places between and behind the teeth,
and wash them out with mouthfuls of water, so that they
don’t get a chance of burrowing and destroying your
grinders.</p>

<p>In pioneer days when the Indians scalped people they
seized them by the hair growing on the crown of the
head, which they called the scalp lock. A very good way
to stand tall and sit tall is to imagine a string tied to your
scalp lock, drawing you up to the ceiling or the sky, and
all the rest of you, both inside and out, will fall into good
position. It is quite painless, so try it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>



<h3>Games and Practices</h3>

<p>A strict obedience to the rules of a game, good temper,
pluck and honest, unselfish play count as much as
skill in playing.</p>

<p>A Scout always shakes hands when she loses a game
and congratulates the winner.</p>


<h4>Day and Night</h4>

<p>The players divide into two parties and form in two
lines, back to back, about three paces apart. One of the
lines is named the “Day Party,” the other the “Night
Party.” The leader has a disk painted black on one side
and a white on the other. (A coin may be used instead
of the disk.) In front of each party is a goal. The
leader throws the disk into the air. If the disk alights
with the white side up the leader calls “Day.” The
“Day Party” then rushes toward its goal and the “Night
Party” pursues, tagging as many players of the “Day
Party” as possible. These they take back to their own
line. The disk is thrown again, and the party whose
side turns up starts for their goal as before. The game
continues in this way until all the players on one of the
sides are lost.</p>


<h4>Dodge Ball</h4>

<p>Of any even number of players, half form a circle,
while the other half stand inside the ring, facing outward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
The players in the center dodge the ball, which, while in
play, is thrown by any of those forming the circle.
Those who are hit with the ball take their places among
those around the circle, and have an equal chance at
those remaining in the center. One is put out at a time.
This is kept up until no one is left in the circle, after
which the players exchange places, that is, those who
were in the circle now form around the circle, and vice
versa.</p>


<h4>Cross Tag</h4>

<p>Any player who is chased may be relieved by any other
player running between her and the one trying to tag
her. The latter must then run after the player who ran
between, till she in turn is relieved.</p>


<h4>Sculptor</h4>

<p>One of the players is chosen as the “Sculptor” and
she arranges the other players in different positions and
attitudes as statues. No player dares move or speak, for
as soon as she does the sculptor punishes her by beating
her with a knotted handkerchief or towel, called the
“sack-beetle.” After having arranged the players to suit
her fancy the sculptor leaves the playground, saying:
“The sculptor is not at home.” No sooner is she gone
than the statues come to life, sing, dance, jump and play
havoc in general. On the return of the sculptor she
counts, “One, two, three,” and any player who is not in
her former posture at “three” receives a beating with
the knotted handkerchief from the sculptor. Should the
sculptor punish the wrong statue all the players rush at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
her with knotted handkerchiefs and drive her to a goal
previously decided upon, and the game is resumed with
some other player as sculptor.</p>


<h4>Inventory Game</h4>

<p>Let each girl go into a room for half a minute and
when she comes out let her make a list of what she has
seen. Then compare lists to find who has seen the most.</p>


<h4>Testing Noses</h4>

<p>This is easiest with the competitors blindfolded. Let
them smell different things and tell what they are. Also
the objects may be placed in bags but this means much
more work.</p>


<h4>Three Deep</h4>

<p>Twenty-four or more players form a circle of pairs
with space enough between the players (who stand closely
one behind the other, facing the center of the circle) to
allow the runners to turn and run in all directions. Two
players on the outside of the circle and at a distance from
each other begin the game. One of these is called the
“tagger,” the other is “It.” She tries to tag “It” before
she can secure a place in front of any of the pairs
forming the circle. If she succeeds, the player who has
been tagged then becomes the “tagger” and the former
“tagger” tries to secure a place in front of some pair.
But whenever the runner (the player pursued) has succeeded
in getting in front of a pair before being tagged,
then the hindmost (the last or third in the respective
rank) must take to her heels and seek to evade the unsuccessful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
“tagger,” who now turns her attention to the
runner. In trying to evade a tagger the successive
player may run in any direction, either left or right, outside
the circle, but not pass in front of any one rank to
another rank in such a manner as to induce wrong starts.
A hindmost player may also form in front of his own
rank, making the second player in such rank hindmost
or “third.” The play is always directed against the
third or last of a rank, two players being the number
limited to each place.</p>

<p>(When numbers of players in the beginning are too
large the circle may be formed by rows or ranks of
threes, instead of twos or pairs.)</p>

<p>Expert players may form several circles and run from
circle to circle, two pairs playing simultaneously. The
above play may be varied in a number of ways.</p>


<h4>Chasing an Owl</h4>

<p>Another good stalking game is chasing the owl. This
is done in thick woods where one Scout represents the
owl hooting at intervals and then moving to one side for
a distance. Each pursuer when seen is called out of the
game, and the owl, if a real good one, may get safely back
to her stump.</p>


<h4>Turkey and Wildcat</h4>

<p>This is played by the turkey blindfolded “going to
roost” in some place where there are plenty of twigs or
dry leaves to crack and rustle. At the first sound the
turkey jumps. If not then within reach of one wildcat,
she is safe and another wildcat has a chance. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
sometimes very laughable for the turkey being blindfolded
may jump right on the wildcat.</p>


<h4>Walking the Plank</h4>

<p>Lay on the ground a couple of boards edgewise with
an apple or small prize on the ground at the end of the
board for the Brownie who can walk the plank, squat or
stoop and pick up the prize, turn round and bring it safely
back again.</p>

<p>(This practice is most valuable in producing concentration
of mind and action—the effort of body-balance
develops mental balance.)</p>


<h4>Stepping-Stones</h4>

<p>Put down small bits of board, or cardboard (nailed
to the ground) or mark on the ground a twisty line of
stepping stones as if for crossing a brook—some close
together, others far apart. Each Brownie to try the
course in turn, two tries. In the second try she carries
in her hand a board about eight inches square on which
is a small ball which, of course, must not be dropped.</p>

<p>(Object similar to that of “Walking the Plank.”)</p>

<p>After you learn to count money up to one hundred
cents or one dollar, it is easy to handle larger sums, such
as five dollars, ten dollars.</p>

<p>The abbreviation for cents is cts. or ¢.</p>

<p>The abbreviation for dollar is this sign: $.</p>

<p>The monogram of the United States, “U. S.,” makes
the dollar sign if you leave off the bottom of the U.</p>



<h4 class="center">Reading the Compass</h4>

<p>Some time ago some wild Australian natives were
taken for a voyage on a ship. They had always been
accustomed to finding their way by tracks on the ground,
so when they got to sea they wondered how the Captain
of the ship found his way across the trackless ocean and
they kept a look-out in the bow looking over in the water
to see if they could discover the footmarks or signs by
which the Captain was finding his way, till at last they
went to him and said, “How do you manage it?” So
the Captain showed them the compass which told him
which way was north, which south, east and west, and
that by reading the compass, and reading his map with
it, he was able to go into strange parts of the world without
ever having been there before, but always able to find
his way because he knew which way was north by the
compass. He marked the points of the compass on his
map and by comparing the map and the compass it led
him north, south, east, or west. And so it is also necessary
for a Girl Scout or a Brownie to know the points of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the compass, because at any time you may be told to go
off to the north or to the south with a message, or you
want to know which way the wind is blowing, whether
it is a north wind which is going to bring cold or an east
wind, rain, and so on. But how can you do this if you
do not know which is the south or which is the north?
When you have not got a compass it is quite easy to judge
this by the sun. The sun gets up in the east and sets in
the west and in the middle of the day it is due south of
you if you are in the northern part of the world. A
Brownie must understand this and the different points
of the compass before she can be considered a good
useful messenger.</p>



<h4 class="center">Clean Knives, Forks and Spoons</h4>

<p>Use very hot water for first cleaning them to get off
the grease. That is the secret of success. Rinse them
and use dry clean towels. But mind you do not put the
white handles of knives in the water, because they are
apt to crack if you do so.</p>



<h4 class="center">Make Doll’s Clothes or Brownie’s Overall</h4>

<p>In Australia there is a school where the boys were
taught farming, but the first thing that a boy had to do
when he got there was to make his own saddle and bridle
for riding a horse. He was only allowed to use that
same saddle during the rest of his time at the school,
some three or four years, so if he did not make it neatly
and well, he was the laughing-stock of the other boys for
the rest of his time. And it is much the same with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Brownies. They are given directions how to make their
clothes but if they make them badly, well then they will
be ashamed of them for the rest of their time as Brownies.
So be careful to listen to all that is told you as to how
you should make the things and then make them as well
as you possibly can.</p>



<h4 class="center">Knitting</h4>

<p>Of course you can do knitting either with a machine or
with knitting needles by hand, but I strongly advise doing
it by hand for though it is a little bit more difficult to
learn at first it is much more pleasing afterwards. By
being able to knit you can do good turns to other people
very often indeed. All people, men and women, are
glad to have warm things made for them in winter time,
and by being able to knit a Brownie can lend a hand and
give great happiness to other people.</p>



<h4 class="center">Fold Clothes Neatly</h4>

<p>A soldier or sailor on going to bed always puts his
clothes neatly in some spot where he can find them readily
in the dark and slip into them quickly in the case of
alarm. And so also Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts do the
same, because you never know when an accident may
happen; the house may be on fire, or a thief may break
in, and you may want your clothes suddenly in the dark.
If you have them already folded in their place, you can
readily find them and be quickly dressed. But if your
clothes are lying all over the place it is impossible to find
them in the dark. But there is another reason also for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
keeping your clothes neatly folded. And that is that
they last much longer when properly taken care of, and
always look neat, instead of getting baggy, worn and
thread-bare. No true Brownie ever leaves her clothes
lying about in an untidy way.</p>



<h4 class="center">To Carry a Message in Your Head</h4>

<p>Scouts and Brownies are very often employed as messengers
and have done very good work. That is why so
many of them have won War Service badges in the
Great War. And the reason they are used is because
they remember what is told them, carry it in their heads
and deliver it properly. A Brownie learns her message
by heart as soon as it is given to her, and repeats it to the
person who gives it; then she keeps on repeating it while
she goes along, and remembers that all the time she is
going she is on duty, and therefore it is her business not
to stop and loiter and look at other things, but to get her
duty done. In this way her attention fixed on her work
she can always deliver her message at the end of the
journey quite correctly as she got it in the first instance.</p>


<h4 class="center">Applying a Triangular Bandage</h4>

<p>This is a thing that every Brownie ought to know how
to do. It looks quite easy when you see other people do
it, but it is most important that you should know how to
do it yourself, and to do it correctly, because when people
are injured it is necessary for a Brownie to keep her
head and to be able to put on the bandage so that it will
do real good, and not merely look like a good bandage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>There are a great many ways of applying the triangular
bandage. When you become a Scout you will learn these.
At present the three most useful ways are given you, and
as you only have three to learn you will be expected to
apply these really well. The large arm-sling is used to
support the forearm and hand. This is how you put it
on. Open out the triangular bandage, lay it across the
patient’s chest so that the point comes under the elbow
of the injured arm. One of the ends will then be over
the good shoulder. Take hold of the other end and bring
it up over the bad shoulder, round the neck, and tie it in
a square or reef knot. Then fold the point over the
elbow and pin it neatly.</p>

<p>To apply a triangular bandage to a sprained ankle,
fold it into what is called a “wide bandage.” This means
bring the point down to the base, then fold it once again.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 519px;"><div class="caption">Wide Bandage</div>

<img src="images/i_034.jpg" width="519" height="123" alt="diagram of folding triangular bandage" />
</div>

<p>Apply the middle of this to the sole of the patient’s
foot, bring the two ends up and cross the bandage firmly
over the instep (or top of foot). Bring the ends round
the ankle tightly, cross at the back, bring up round again
and tie in a square or reef knot. This bandage is useless
unless applied very firmly. A good way of insuring its
getting tighter instead of looser, after it is applied is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
wet the bandage: it will then shrink in drying and tighten
the pressure evenly all over.</p>



<h3>Proficiency Badges for Brownies</h3>

<p>Now having won your First Class as a Brownie, you
can go on and do great things. You can earn badges
to wear on your arms. Look at these and see which you
would like, and go in and win.</p>

<p>These are the Proficiency Badges for which First Class
Brownies may qualify. They are in four groups.</p>

<h3>WHAT IS A GIRL SCOUT?</h3>

<p>This is a Girl Scout.</p>

<p>She is in her uniform, wearing her badges of rank and
awards for proficiency.</p>

<img src="images/i_040.jpg" width="146" height="374" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A Girl Scout.</div>
</div>

<p>The stripes on her left breast and the badge in her hat
show that she is a Patrol Leader—that is, she commands
a group of seven other Scouts who form the
“Patrol.” She carries in her hand the flag of the Patrol.
The badge on her right breast is that for “War Service”—meaning
that she has done public service during the
war.</p>

<h4 class="center">What Do Girl Scouts Do?</h4>

<p>Look on the cover and you will see that they are jolly
people who enjoy themselves, they are a happy sisterhood
who do good turns to other people.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 223px;">
<img src="images/i_041.jpg" width="223" height="280" alt="munitions worker" />
<div class="caption">As a Munition Worker.</div>
</div>

<p>In Europe Girl Scouts are called Girl Guides and this
is what they have done abroad during the Great War.</p>

<p>In the towns they have helped at the Military Hospitals
as assistants to the ward-maids, cooks, and laundry
women. In the Government offices, such as the War
Office, the Admiralty, and other great departments of the
State, they have acted as orderlies and messengers. They
have taken up work in factories, or as motor-drivers, or
on farms, in order to release men to go to the front.</p>

<p>At home and in their club-rooms they have made bandages
for the wounded, and warm clothing for the men at
the Front and in the Fleet.</p>

<div class="center">
(S.T. stands for “Stand tall and Sit tall”)<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>In the country they have collected eggs for the sick,
and on the moors have gathered sphagnum moss for the
hospitals.</p>

<p>Over in France a great Recreation and Rest Hut for
the soldiers has been supplied by the Guides with funds
earned through their work. It is managed by Guide
officers, or ex-Guides. Among the older Guides there
are many who have done noble work with the Hospitals
at home and overseas; there was one in particular who
went through great adventures in Serbia during the invasion
of that country.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 316px;">
<img src="images/i_042.jpg" width="316" height="239" alt="Guide in smock with cross standing by bed" />
<div class="caption">A Hostel Scout.</div>
</div>

<p>At home in many of the great cities the Scouts have
turned their Headquarters’ Club-Rooms into “Hostels.”
That is, they have made them into small hospitals ready
for taking in people injured in air-raids by the enemy.</p>

<p>So altogether the Scouts have shown themselves to be
a pretty useful lot in many different kinds of works during
the war, and, mind you, they are only girls between
the ages of 11 and 18. But they have done their bit in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the Great War as far as they were able, and have done
it well.</p>

<p>There are 64,000 of them, and they are very smart, and
ready for any job that may be demanded of them.</p>

<p>They were not raised for this special work during the
war, for they began some years before it, but their
motto is “Be Prepared,” and it was their business to
train themselves to be ready for anything that might
happen, even the most unlikely thing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 167px;">

<div class="caption">Scout Orderly.</div>
</div>

<p>So even when war came they were “all there” and
ready for it.</p>

<p>It is not only in Great Britain that they have been
doing this, but—in Canada and Australia, West, East,
and South Africa, New Zealand, the Falkland Islands,
West Indies, and India. The Scouts are a vast sisterhood
of girls, ready to do anything they can for their
country and Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>In this book I will show you as briefly as possible how
you become a Scout, and what you have to do to make
yourself fit for service. And I can tell you right off
now that one thing you’ve got to do is to laugh and
enjoy it all; you can’t help doing so when you get into it.</p>


<h4 class="center">What the Guides Do</h4>

<p>As a Guide your first duty is to be helpful to other
people, both in small everyday matters and also under the
worst of circumstances. You have to imagine to yourself
what sort of things might possibly happen, and how you
should deal with them when they occur. Then you will
know what to do.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 289px;">

<div class="caption">Finding the Wounded.</div>
</div>

<p>I was present when a German aeroplane dropped a
bomb on to a railway station in London. There was the
usual busy scene of people seeing to their luggage, saying
good-bye and going off by train, when with a sudden
bang a whole car was blown to bits, and the adjoining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
ones were in a blaze; seven or eight of those active in
getting into the train were flung down—mangled and
dead; while some thirty more were smashed, broken,
and bleeding, but still alive. The suddenness of it made
it all the more horrifying. But one of the first people I
noticed as keeping their heads was a smartly dressed
young lady kneeling by an injured working-man; his
thigh was smashed and bleeding terribly; she had ripped
up his trouser with her knife, and with strips of it had
bound a pad to the wound; she found a cup somehow and
filled it with water for him from the overhead hose for
filling engines. Instead of being hysterical and useless,
she was as cool and ready to do the right thing as if
she had been in bomb-raids every day of her life. Well,
that is what any girl can do if she only prepares herself
for it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 267px;">
<img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="267" height="214" alt="Guidein nurses uniform helping man on ground" />
<div class="caption">Binding up Injuries.</div>
</div>

<p>Long before there was any idea of the war the Scouts
had been taught to think out and to practise what they
should do supposing such a thing as war happened in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
their own country, or that people should get injured by
bombs or by accidents in their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>In order to be able to deal with such cases the first
thing that you have to know is how to go out in the
country and find the wounded by following their tracks
to where they have crawled away to hide themselves or
get water; you must know how to bind up their wounds
temporarily; how to light a fire and boil up some hot
soup, or fomentations for their injuries; you must be
able to signal to other Scouts in the distance in order
to call up help; you must be able to make a shelter out
of the brush-wood around you, or to rig up a stretcher or
means of carrying the injured on carts or barrows and
so to get them in to hospital.</p>

<p>Then you have to know how to turn a room or a cellar
into a ward, how to make up beds and apparatus for the
use of the sick and wounded; how to nurse them; how to
change their bandages; how to cook their food; what sort
of ventilation is necessary; how to wash the linen and
so on.</p>


<h4 class="center">Convalescent Nursing</h4>

<p>Finally there comes the convalescent stage when your
patients are getting better, and you have to give them more
nourishing food, cooked in a tempting manner, and you
have to keep their minds active and cheerful by being
able to read or sing to them, and so to cheer them back
to life.</p>

<p>These are things which have to be learnt in peace-time,
and because they were learnt by the Scouts beforehand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
these girls were able to do their bit so well when war
came.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/i_047a.jpg" width="275" height="282" alt="Guide in nurses' uniform bringing drink to man in wheelchair" />
<div class="caption">Cheering them back to life.</div>
</div>


<h4 class="center">Frontier Life</h4>

<p>But they have to Be Prepared for many other things
besides sickness. It falls to the lot of very many girls to
take up life Overseas, and very often it is a rough life,
and one full of adventures and romance.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 97px;">
<img src="images/i_047b.jpg" width="97" height="126" alt="rooster" />
</div>

<p>But although this sounds nice in books and stories it
is no fun for a girl who has had everything done for
her at home, to find herself stranded in an outlandish
place with no one available to help her, no
water or gas laid on, no shops, or bakers, no
cooks, no doctors.</p>

<p>She has to do everything for herself. This
is where so many women, who had charge of
ambulances in Serbia and other countries during the war,
came out so splendidly, doing everything for themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and showing the greatest possible courage and handiness
in the difficulties and dangers of active service.</p>

<div class="center">S.T.</div>

<p>A story which should appeal with special force to Girl
Scouts is that of Emilienne Moreau.</p>

<p>She is a French girl, and was living at Loos where the
heavy fighting took place in October, 1915.</p>

<p>When the Germans took the place and held it, after
their retreat from the Marne a year before, she, with
her family, remained there and made the best of things
under the German occupation.</p>

<p>She lived with her aged father and invalid mother, a
sister, and a small brother of ten.</p>

<p>The father, broken in health and spirits by the presence
of the hated Germans, died. Loos was practically empty
of inhabitants, business was at a standstill—it was impossible
to get a coffin even in which to bury the poor
man.</p>

<p>So this girl, with the help of her young brother, got
hold of some planks and themselves made one for their
father’s body.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 72px;">
<img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="72" height="93" alt="bird on perch" />
</div>

<p>In September she noticed that the German garrison of
the place were getting disturbed. More men
were put into the town, and more defensive works
were made. Shells began to fall, and the firing
to become more intense day by day.</p>

<p>Instead of hiding in the cellar she climbed into the roof,
where through a hole in the tiles, she was able to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
fighting that went on between the German defenders
and the Highlanders who were attacking.</p>

<p>For several days it continued, but the Scotsmen finally
got into the town and drove the Germans out from street
to street with hand-to-hand fightings.</p>

<p>In a hidden corner five Germans kept fighting our troops
unseen until this girl discovered their position.</p>

<p>She got hold of some hand-grenades and threw them
in among them, killing three of them. The two survivors
attacked her with bayonets, but she had armed herself
with the revolver belonging to a dead British officer, and
as they came at her she turned it on them with quick
and steady aim and shot them both.</p>

<p>Then she went to work, regardless of the danger of
rifle fire and shrapnel, tending the wounded, rendering
first-aid, bringing water and blankets to them, thereby
saving their lives and easing the pain of a number of
British soldiers.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 122px;">
<img src="images/i_049.jpg" width="122" height="85" alt="blackbird" />
</div>

<p>Our officers found her doing these things. She was
personally thanked and congratulated by the British general
for her valuable assistance to the medical staff, and
for her courage and gallant help against
the enemy, and she was later on awarded
the French Military Cross “for valour
on the field of battle.” Later we heard
that Emilienne Moreau was a French Girl Scout, and
what this gallant French girl did, her sister Girl Scouts
in Britain would, I hope, also do in similar circumstances.</p>

<p>But it could only be done when a girl has trained herself
as the Scouts do to be plucky, to be handy, to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
cool, to know what is the right thing to do—and to do
it at no matter what risk to herself.</p>


<h4 class="center">Frontierswomen</h4>

<p>I have met many fine frontierswomen in my time. In
Matabeleland, when the natives rose against us, Mrs.
Selous, the wife of the great elephant hunter, was alone
in her home, thirty miles away from the nearest town.
Some natives living close by came and asked her for the
loan of as many axes as she could spare, as they wanted
to chop firewood. Shortly afterwards her husband, who
had been away shooting, came galloping in, and told her
to saddle and mount her horse at once and to get away
as the natives were “up” and murdering the white inhabitants.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 312px;">

<div class="caption">A Frontier-woman’s Ride for Life.</div>
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 61px;">
<img src="images/i_050b.jpg" width="61" height="125" alt="bird on branch singing" />
</div>

<p>Being a frontierswoman it did not take her long
to catch and saddle up her horse, and in a few minutes
she and her husband had left their home, and
were riding for their lives towards Bulawayo. Before
they were out of sight of their house they could see
smoke and flames already issuing from it. The natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
who had borrowed the axes had done so with the object of
murdering them, and finding that they had escaped, were
now wreaking their vengeance on their property. It was
just Mrs. Selous’ promptness, cool-headedness, and ability
to ride that saved her life.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 77px;">
<img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="77" height="96" alt="bird standing" />
</div>

<p>Another woman at that time was similarly out on her
farm, while her husband was away in some other part
of the country. The natives surrounded her house in
the night and attacked her faithful native servants.
Knowing her danger, she slept in her clothes, and realising
what was the matter when she heard the noise of
the attack, she seized her revolver and, slipping out of
the house through a back window, she escaped into the
garden and hid herself behind a tombstone there. In
the early dawn the marauders departed, and she came
out of her hiding-place to find her home wrecked and
her faithful servants all killed. A relief party of white
men soon after arrived from the nearest township, and
found her quite self-possessed and calm. The only excitement
she showed was her intense relief at the fact that
one of the attackers had seized her sewing machine and
was making off with it when he was killed by one of
her men, and had dropped the machine at a spot where it
just escaped falling down the well. So she rode back to
Salisbury in triumph with her rescuers, clutching
her beloved sewing machine. She had no
sooner reached safety than she discovered that
she had dropped her revolver, and she insisted
on going back again to find it. You might think that she
could have got a new revolver in the town, but that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
not the question. The revolver was a favourite of hers,
because, although old and rather out of gear, she had
once killed a lion with it.</p>

<p>She had many other exciting adventures in Rhodesia
which I have not space to tell here, but she was a splendid
type of what a London girl can do when put to it in
places of difficulty and danger, if only she has trained
herself.</p>

<div class="center">S.T.</div>

<p>The story of Laura Secord, the heroine of Canada,
shows what a frontierswoman may be called upon to do,
and what she can do if only she has Been Preparing herself
in strength of mind and body like a Scout.</p>

<p>Canada was at war with the United States over a hundred
years ago. Battles between the Americans and the
English were being fought on all sides in that unhappy
year 1812. After the engagement on Queenstown
Heights a terror-stricken woman went tramping over the
field where the slain were lying in search of her husband.
Laura Secord had heard that her husband had been
wounded and left there for dead; but on finding him, to
her joy she discovered that he was still alive, though
badly injured.</p>

<p>It was during his long illness that a report was brought
to Laura Secord that the Americans were again coming
to surprise the English, unknown to the general.</p>

<p>Owing to her pluck and determination, Laura achieved
a famous deed of heroism and saved her country by taking
the information of the advance of the enemy right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
away to the commanding officer of the British troops.
Through difficulties and dangers she sped without a fear
for her own safety; she trudged on through forests and
bogs, going twenty miles round out of the beaten track
so as to avoid being traced. In the dusk of the evening
her path was checked by a deep stream. Here she felt
almost hopeless, until she found a tree-trunk fallen across
the water, and by this she managed to scramble to the
opposite bank. Whilst dreading what might happen at
home to her invalid husband and her little children left
behind, Laura Secord still pressed forward through the
darkness, tired and weak, till she at length reached the
British camp, and was able to unburden her mind and
give the news of the danger to the officer in command.
All present were struck with admiration for her gallant
effort, and with the knowledge of the impending danger
thus gained, the British were able to <small>BE PREPARED</small>.</p>

<p>Now, did not this Laura Secord, though quite untrained,
do every part of the duty of a Girl Scout? She showed
<small>SENSE OF DUTY</small> in leaving all that was dearest to her to
go off to the commander.</p>

<p>She showed cleverness and <small>RESOURCE</small> in
getting through the American outposts by
driving her cow in front of her, pretending
that she was merely taking her out to graze.</p>

<p>She showed <small>ENDURANCE</small> going such a long journey
rapidly and well, being healthy and fit for hard work.</p>

<p>Also <small>CAMPAIGNING</small> in being able to find her way by a
circuitous route through forests and by night, and yet not
seen by the enemy—<small>SAVING LIFE</small>, too, not only of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
soldiers in the force, but eventually of all her nation, by
freeing her country of the enemy.</p>

<p>She showed <small>PATRIOTISM</small> by sacrificing her own wishes
for the good of her country, and risking her life for the
good of her nation.</p>



<h3>Why “Scouts”?</h3>

<p>On the North-West Frontier of India there is a famous
Corps of soldiers known as the Scouts, and their duty
is to be always ready to turn out at any moment to repel
raids by the hostile tribes across the Border, and to
prevent them from coming down into the peaceful plains
of India. This body of men must be prepared for every
kind of fighting. Sometimes on foot, sometimes on
horseback, sometimes in the mountains, often with pioneer
work, wading through rivers and making bridges, and
so on. But they have to be a skilful lot of men, brave
and enduring, ready to turn out at any time, winter or
summer, or to sacrifice themselves if necessary in order
that peace may reign throughout India while they keep
down any hostile raids against it. So they are true
handymen in every sense of the word, and true patriots.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/i_055.jpg" width="336" height="604" alt="mouintain climber" />
<div class="caption">Facing a Difficulty.</div>
</div>

<p>When people speak of Scouts in Europe one naturally
thinks of those men who are mountaineers in Switzerland
and other mountainous place, who can guide people over
the most difficult parts by their own bravery and skill in
tackling obstacles, by helpfulness to those with them, and
by their bodily strength of wind and limb. They are
splendid fellows those guides, and yet if they were told
to go across the same amount of miles on an open flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
plain it would be nothing to them, it would not be interesting,
and they would not be able to display those
grand qualities which they show directly the country is a
bit broken up into mountains. It is no fun to them to
walk by easy paths, the whole excitement of life is facing
difficulties and dangers and apparent impossibilities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and in the end getting a chance of attaining the summit
of the mountain they have wanted to reach.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/i_056.jpg" width="280" height="303" alt="Scout in the shape of a roadsign" />
<div class="caption">Why “Scout”?</div>
</div>

<p>Well, I think it is the case with most girls nowadays.
They do not want to sit down and lead an idle life, not
to have everything done for them, nor to have a very
easy time. They don’t want merely to walk across the
plain, they would much rather show themselves handy
people, able to help others and ready, if necessary, to
sacrifice themselves for others just like the Scouts on
the North-west Frontier. And they also want to tackle
difficult jobs themselves in their life, to face mountains
and difficulties and dangers, and to go at them having
prepared themselves to be skilful and brave; and also
they would like to help other people to get over their
difficulties also. When they attain success after facing
difficulties, then they feel really happy and triumphant.
It is a big satisfaction to them to have succeeded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to have made other people succeed also. That is what
the Girl Scouts want to do, just like the mountaineer
guides do among the mountains.</p>

<p>Then, too, a woman who can do things is looked up
to by others, both men and women, and they are always
ready to follow her advice and example, so there she
becomes a Scout too. And later on if she has children
of her own, or if she becomes a teacher of children,
she can be a really good Scout to them.</p>

<p>In fact, if one caricatured a Scout one would draw her
thus:—“Turn to the right and keep straight on.” And
for these reasons the name Scout was given to them originally.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 71px;">
<img src="images/i_057.jpg" width="71" height="65" alt="bird" />
</div>

<p>By means of games and activities which the Scouts
practise they are able to learn the different things which
will help them to get on in life, and show the way to
others to get on also. Thus camping and signalling, first
aid work, camp cooking, and all these things that
the Scouts practise are all going to be helpful to
them afterwards in making them strong, resourceful
women, skilful and helpful to others, and strong in
body as well as in mind, and what is more it makes them
a jolly cheery lot of comrades also.</p>



<h3>“Be Prepared!”</h3>

<p>The motto of the Scouts on which they work is “Be
Prepared,” that is, be ready for any kind of duty that
may be thrust upon them, and what is more, to know what
to do by having practised it beforehand in the case of
any kind of accident or any kind of work that they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
be asked to take up. Thousands of women have done
splendid work in this war, but thousands more would
have been able to do good work also had they only Been
Prepared for it beforehand by learning a few things
that are useful to them outside their mere school work or
work in their own home. And that is what the Scouts
are learning in all their games and camp work; they
mean to be useful in other ways besides what they are
taught in school.</p>



<h3>How to Join</h3>

<p>You join a Troop in your neighborhood and become a
member of one of the Patrols in it. A Patrol is a group
of eight girls, under the command of a Patrol Leader.
Each Patrol is called after a bird or a flower, and has
that flower or bird embroidered on its flag. The Patrol
is the team for play or for work, and each Patrol endeavors—or
at least considers itself—to be the best in
the Troop.</p>

<p>If there is no Troop in your neighborhood you can
become a “<i>Lone Scout</i>.” That is, you can make the
promise, carry out the Scout Law and all the
practices by yourself, and you can wear the uniform
and win the badges.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 88px;">
<img src="images/i_058.jpg" width="88" height="60" alt="bird in flight" />
</div>

<p>For this you must report and be registered. That is,
if you cannot hear of a Scout officer near you, write to
the Secretary at Headquarters, tell her where you live
and she will put you in touch with the nearest officer who
will register you and help you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>


<h3>Scout Ranks</h3>

<p>At first you rank as a Candidate until you pass your
Tenderfoot tests. Then you can go on and rise to the
following ranks:—</p>


<ul class="normal"><li>Candidate.</li>
<li>Tenderfoot.</li>
<li>Second-Class Scout.</li>
<li>First-Class Scout.</li>
<li>Corporal.</li>
<li>Patrol Leader.</li>
<li>Senior Scout or Citizen Scout.</li></ul>





<h3>HOW TO BECOME A TENDERFOOT</h3>

<div class="center">S.T.</div>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>A. You must learn the <i>Scout Law</i>.</p>

<p>B. You must make the <i>Scout’s Promise</i>.</p>

<p>C. You must learn the <i>Salute and the Woodcraft
Signs</i> of the Scouts.</p>

<p>D. You must understand how the <i>Flag</i> is made up, and
how it should be flown.</p>

<p>E. You must be able to tie <i>knots</i> and know what they
are used for; any four of the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
Reef-knot, Sheet bend, Clove-hitch, Bowline,
Fisherman’s knot, Sheepshank.</div>

<p>F. Elementary Scout’s Drill.</p></div>

<p>This may seem to be rather a lot of things to learn,
but they are really very easy, and I will show you in the
next few pages how to do it without much trouble.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>When you can do these you will no longer be a Candidate,
you will be admitted into the Scouts as a “Tenderfoot,”
and can then go on and win badges.</p>


<h3>The Tenderfoot Badge</h3>

<p>The Badge of the Girl Scouts is the
“Trefoil” (three leaves), which represent
the three promises made on joining, as the
three fingers held up in the salute also do.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 140px;">
<img src="images/i_060.jpg" width="140" height="129" alt="Girl Scout pin" />
</div>

<p>The proper place for the Tenderfoot
Badge is in the centre of the loose ends of the tie.</p>



<h3>A. THE GIRL SCOUT’S LAW</h3>

<div class="hang1">
1. <span class="smcap">A Girl Scout’s Honor is to be Trusted.</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>If a Scout says “On my honour it is so,” that
means that it <i>is</i> so just as if she had taken a most
solemn oath.</p>

<p>Similarly, if a captain says to a Scout, “I trust you
on your honor to do this,” the Scout is bound to
carry out the order to the very best of her ability,
and to let nothing interfere with her doing so.</p>

<p>If a Scout were to break her honor by telling a lie,
or by not carrying out an order exactly when trusted
on her honor to do so, she would cease to be a Scout,
for the time being, and she may be required to hand
over her Scout badge.</p></div>

<div class="hang1">2. <span class="smcap">A Scout is Loyal</span></div>

<div class="blockquot3">

to the President and to her officers, to her mother
and father, to her employers, to those who may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
under her, and to her friends. She must stick to
them through thick and thin against any one who is
their enemy, or who even talks badly of them. A
Scout will not talk ill of them herself.</div>

<div class="hang1">3. <span class="smcap">A Scout’s Duty is to be Useful and to Help
Others.</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She is to do her duty before anything else, even
though she gives up her own pleasure, or comfort,
or safety to do it. When in difficulty to know which
of two things to do, she must ask herself, “Which
is my duty?”—that is, “Which is best for other
people?”—and do that one. She must Be Prepared
at any time to save life and to help injured persons.
And <i>she should do at least one good turn</i> to somebody
every day.</p></div>

<div class="hang1">4. <span class="smcap">A Scout is a Friend to All, and a Sister to
Every Other Scout.</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thus, if a Scout meets another Scout, even though
a stranger to her, she may speak to her, and help
her in any way that she can, either to carry out the
duty she is then doing, or by giving her food, or,
as far as possible, anything that she may be in want
of. A Scout must never be a <small>SNOB</small>. A snob is one
who looks down upon another because she is poorer,
or who is poor and resents another because she is
rich. A Scout is like Kim—“Little friend to all the
world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p></div>

<div class="hang1">5. <span class="smcap">A Scout is Courteous—</span></div>

<div class="blockquot3">
that is, she is polite to all—but especially to old
people and invalids, cripples, etc. And she must not
take any reward for being helpful or courteous.</div>

<div class="hang1">6. <span class="smcap">A Girl Scout Keeps Herself Pure. She is Clean
in Word, in Thought, in Deed.</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She is strong enough in her mind to be above talking
or listening to dirty subjects. She keeps herself
pure, clean-minded, and womanly.</p></div>

<div class="hang1">7. <span class="smcap">A Scout is a Friend to Animals.</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She should save them as far as possible from pain,
and should not kill any animal unnecessarily, not
even the smallest of God’s creatures.</p></div>

<div class="hang1">8. <span class="smcap">A Scout Obeys Orders</span></div>

<div class="blockquot3">

of her parents, patrol leader, or Captain without
question. Even if she gets an order she does not
like she must do as soldiers and sailors do—she
must carry it out all the same <i>because it is her duty</i>.
After she has done it she can come and state any
reasons against it; but she must carry out the order
at once. That is discipline.</div>

<div class="hang1">9. <span class="smcap">A Girl Scout is Cheerful</span></div>

<div class="blockquot3">

under all difficulties. When she gets an order she
should obey it cheerily and readily, not in a slow,
hang-dog sort of way, and should sing even if she
dislikes it.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>When she is in trouble or in pain it will at once
relieve her if she forces herself to smile—to “grin
and bear it.”</p>

<p>Scouts never grumble at hardships, nor whine at
each other, nor frown when put out.</p>

<p>A Scout goes about with a smile and singing. It
cheers her and cheers other people, especially in
time of danger, for she keeps it up then all the same.</p></div>

<div class="hang1">10. <span class="smcap">A Scout is Thrifty—</span></div>

<div class="blockquot3">

that is, she saves every penny she can, and puts it
into the bank, so that she may have money to keep
herself when out of work, and thus not make herself
a burden to others; or that she may have money
to give away to others when they need it.</div>


<h4 class="center">How Camping Teaches the Scout Law</h4>

<p>Last year a man went out into the woods to try and
see if he could live like the prehistoric men used to do;
that is to say, he took nothing with him in the way of
food or equipment or even clothing—he went just as he
was, and started out to make his own living as best he
could. Of course the first thing he had to do was to
make some sort of tool or weapon by which he could kill
some animals, cut his wood and make his fire and so on.
So he made a stone axe, and with that was able to cut
out branches of trees so that he could make a trap in
which he eventually caught a bear and killed it. He then
cut up the bear and used the skin for blankets and the
flesh for food. He also cut sticks and made a little instrument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
by which he was able to ignite bits of wood and
so start his fire. He also searched out various roots
and berries and leaves, which he was able to cook and
make into good food, and he even went so far as to make
charcoal and to cut slips of bark from the trees and draw
pictures of the scenery and animals around him. In
this way he lived for over a month in the wild, and came
out in the end very much better in health and spirits and
with a great experience of life. For he had learned to
shift entirely for himself and to be independent of the
different things we get in civilisation to keep us going in
comfort.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;">
<img src="images/i_064.jpg" width="383" height="324" alt="man in skins, barefoot, putting top hat on tree" />
<div class="caption">“He went just as he was!”</div>
</div>

<p>That is why we go into camp a good deal in the Boy
Scout and in the Girl Scout movements, because in camp
life we learn to do without so many things which while
we are in houses we think are necessary, and find that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
can do for ourselves many things where we used to think
ourselves helpless. And before going into camp it is
just as well to learn some of the things that will be
most useful to you when you get there. And that is
what we teach in the Headquarters of the Girl Scout
Troops before they go out and take the field. For instance,
you must know how to light your own fire; how
to collect dry enough wood to make it burn; because you
will not find gas stoves out in the wild. Then you have
to learn how to find your own water, and good water
that will not make you ill. You have not a whole cooking
range or a kitchen full of cooking pots, and so you have
to learn to cook your food in the simplest way with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
means at your hand, such as a simple cooking pot or a
roasting stick or an oven made with your own hands
out of an old tin box or something of that kind.</p>

<h4 class="center">Nature Study</h4>

<p>It is only while in camp that one can really learn to
study Nature in the proper way and not as you merely
do it inside the school; because here you are face to face
with Nature at all hours of the day and night. For the
first time you live under the stars and can watch them by
the hour and see what they really look like, and realise
what an enormous expanse of almost endless space they
cover. You know from your lessons at school that our
sun warms and lights up a large number of different
worlds like ours, all circling round it in the Heavens.
And when you hold up a coin at arm’s length and look
at the sky, the coin covers no less than two hundred
of those suns, each with their different little worlds
circling round them. And you then begin to realise what
an enormous endless space the Heavens comprise. You
realise perhaps for the first time the enormous work of
God.</p>

<img src="images/i_066a.jpg" width="295" height="86" alt="caterpillar" />
<div class="caption">Green Caterpillar.</div>
</div>

<p>Then also in camp you are living among plants of
every kind, and you can study them in their natural state,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
how they grow and what they look like, instead of merely
seeing pictures of them in books or dried specimens of
them in collections.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 236px;">
<img src="images/i_066b.jpg" width="236" height="85" alt="looksl ike chrysallis" />
<div class="caption">Pupa.</div>
</div>

<p>All round you, too, are the birds and animals and insects,
and the more you know of them the more you begin
to like them and to take an interest in them; and
once you take an interest in them you do not want to
hurt them in any way. You would not rob a bird’s nest;
you would not bully an animal; you would not kill an
insect—once you have realised what its life and habits
are. In this way, therefore, you fulfil the Scout Law of
becoming a friend to animals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/i_067.jpg" width="404" height="229" alt="Butterfly" />
<div class="caption">Cabbage Butterfly.</div>
</div>

<p>By living in camp you begin to find that though there
are many discomforts and difficulties to be got over, they
can be got over with a little trouble and especially if you
smile at them and tackle them.</p>

<p>Then living among other comrades in camp you have
to be helpful and do good turns at almost every minute,
and you have to exercise a great deal of give and take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and good temper, otherwise the camp would become
unbearable.</p>

<div class="center">S.T.</div>

<p>So you carry out the different laws of courteousness, of
helpfulness, and friendliness to others that come in the
Scout Law. Also you pick up the idea of how necessary
it is to keep everything in its place, and to keep your
kit and tent and ground as clean as possible; otherwise
you get into a horrible state of dirt, and dirt brings flies
and other inconveniences.</p>

<p>You save every particle of food and in this way you
learn not only cleanliness, but thrift and economy. And
you very soon realise how cheaply you can live in camp,
and how very much enjoyment you can get for very little
money. And as you live in the fresh, pure air of God you
find that your own thoughts are clean and pure as the
air around you. There is hardly one of the Scout Laws
that is not better carried out after you have been living
and practising it in camp.</p>



<h3>B. THE SCOUT PROMISE</h3>

<p>On my honour I will try—</p>


<ul class="smallin"><li>1. <span class="smcap">To do my Duty to God and to my Country.</span></li>
<li>2. <span class="smcap">To help other people at all times.</span></li>
<li>3. <span class="smcap">To obey the Scout Law.</span></li>
</ul>



<h4 class="center">Duty to God</h4>

<p>An old British chieftain, some thirteen hundred years
ago, said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Our life has always seemed to me like the flight of
a sparrow through the great hall, when one is sitting at
meals with the log-fire blazing on the hearth, while all
is storm and darkness outside. He comes in, no one
knows from where, and hovers for a short time in the
warmth and light, and then flies forth again into the
darkness. And so it is with the life of a man; he comes
no one knows from where; he is here in the world for a
short time, till he flies forth again, no one knows whither.
But now you show us that if we do our duty during our
life we shall not fly out into darkness again, when life is
ended, since Christ has opened a door, for us to enter a
brighter room, a heaven where we can go and dwell in
peace for ever.”</p>


<p>Religion seems a very simple thing:</p>

<ul class="smallin"><li>1st. To trust in God.</li>
<li>2nd. To do good to other people.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="center">The Knights</h4>

<p>The old knights, who were the scouts of the nation,
were very religious. They were always careful to attend
religious service, especially before going into battle or
undertaking any serious difficulty. They considered it
was the right thing always to be prepared for death. In
the great church of Malta you can see to-day where the
old knights used to pray, and they all stood up and drew
their swords during the reading of the Creed, as a sign
that they were prepared to defend the gospel with their
swords and lives. Besides worshipping God in church,
the knights always recognised His work in the things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
which He made, such as animals, plants, and scenery.
And so it is with the Scouts to-day, that wherever they
go they love the woodlands, the mountains, and the prairies,
and they like to watch and know about the animals
that inhabit them, and the wonders of the flowers and
plants. No man is much good, either to himself or to
others, unless he believes in God and obeys His laws.
So every Scout should have a religion.</p>


<h4 class="center">Regiments in God’s Army</h4>

<p>There are many kinds of religion, such as Roman
Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Mohammedans, and so on,
but the main point about them is that they all worship
God, although in different ways. They are like an army
which serves one king, though it is divided into different
branches, such as cavalry, artillery, and infantry, and
these wear different uniforms. So, when you meet a
girl of a different religion from your own, you should
not be hostile to her, but recognise that she is still serving
the same king as you.</p>

<p>In doing your duty to God always be grateful to Him.
Whenever you enjoy a pleasure or a good game, or succeed
in doing a good thing, thank Him for it, if only with
a word or two, just as you say grace after a meal. And
it is a good thing to bless other people. For instance, if
you see a train starting off, just pray for God’s blessing
on all that are in the train.</p>

<p>In doing your duty towards man be helpful and generous,
and also always be grateful for any kindness done
to you, and be careful to show that you are grateful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">How to Become a Star</h4>

<p>Remember that a present given to you is not yours until
you have thanked the giver for it. While you are the
sparrow flying through the hall, that is to say, while you
are living your life on this earth, try and do something
good which may remain after you. One writer says:</p>

<p>“I often think that when the sun goes down the world
is hidden by a big blanket from the light of heaven, but
the stars are little holes pierced in that blanket by those
who have done good deeds in this world. The stars are
not all the same size; some are big, some little, and some
men have done great deeds and others have done small
deeds, but they have made their hole in the blanket by
doing good before they went to heaven.”</p>

<p>Try and make your hole in the blanket by good work
while you are on the earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It is something to be good, but it is far better to
do good.</span></p>


<h4 class="center">Duty to God and Country</h4>

<p>Have you ever thought what a lot we owe to the Kaiser
William of Germany. If he had not tried for world
power, we should never have come together so closely as
we have done with all our brothers and sisters overseas.</p>



<h3>C. SIGNS AND SIGNALS</h3>


<h4 class="center">The Scout’s Salute</h4>

<p>The right hand raised level with shoulder, palm to the
front, thumb resting on the nail of the little finger, and
the other three fingers upright pointing upward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>That is the Scout Salute.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 126px;">
<img src="images/i_072.jpg" width="126" height="391" alt="slouching standing scout" />
<div class="caption">Not the best
way to salute.</div>
</div>

<p>The three fingers held up (like the three points of a
Scout Badge) remind her of her three
promises in the Scout Promise.</p>

<ul class="smallin">
<li>1. To do her duty to God and Country.</li>
<li>2. To help others.</li>
<li>3. To obey the Scout Law.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a Scout meets another for the first
time in the day, whether she is a comrade or
a stranger, she salutes.</p>

<p>She always salutes an officer—that is a
Patrol Leader or a Captain.</p>

<p>Also the hoisting of the Flag, the colors
of a regiment, the playing of Star Spangled
Banner.</p>

<p>When the National Anthem is played the
Scouts do not salute, but merely stand at
attention.</p>

<p>When marching in Troop or Patrol formation do not
salute with the hand. When passing other Troops or
a superior officer, the officer or Patrol Leader in charge
alone will salute with the hand, at the same time giving
the command, “Eyes right,” or “Eyes left,” as the case
may be, on which every Scout will turn her head sharply
in that direction till the officer gives the word “Eyes
front.”</p>

<p>It is more than ever necessary to hold yourself smartly
when giving the salute, otherwise you would make a very
slovenly show of it.</p>

<p>[<i>Practise this.</i>]</p>


<h4 class="center">Signals and Signs</h4>

<p>When a Captain wants to call her Scouts together she
sounds her whistle. Then they <i>double</i> to the Captain.</p>


<p><i>Whistle signals</i> are there:—</p>

<p>One long blast means “Halt,” “Silence,” “Alert,”
“Look out for my next signal,” or “Cease.” (Stop
what you’re doing, look out for next command.)</p>

<p>A succession of long, slow blasts means “Go out,”
“Get farther away,” or “Advance,” “Extend,” “Scatter.”</p>

<p>A succession of short, sharp blasts means “Rally,”
“Close in,” “Come together,” “Fall in.”</p>

<p>A succession of short and long blasts alternately means
“Alarm,” “Look out,” “Be ready,” “Man your alarm
posts.”</p>

<p>Three short blasts followed by one long one from Scout
Captain calls up the patrol leaders—that is, “Leaders
come here!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Any whistle signal must be instantly obeyed at the
double as fast as ever you can run, no matter what other
job you may be doing at the time.</p>

<p><i>Hand signals</i> (which can also be made by patrol leaders
with their patrol flags when necessary):—</p>


<h4 class="center">Hand Signals</h4>

<p>“<i>Advance</i>,” “Forward.”—Swing the arm from rear
to front, below the shoulder.</p>

<p>“<i>Retire.</i>”—Circle the arm above the head.</p>

<p>“<i>Halt.</i>”—Raise the arm to full extension above the
head, etc.</p>

<p>“<i>Double.</i>”—The closed fist moved up and down between
your shoulder and thigh.</p>

<p>“<i>Quick Time.</i>”—To change from the “Double” to
the Quick Time, raise the hand to the shoulder.</p>

<p>“<i>Reinforce.</i>”—Swing the arm from the rear to the
front above the shoulder.</p>

<p>“<i>Lie down.</i>”—With the open hand make two or three
slight movements towards the ground.</p>

<p>“<i>Wheel.</i>”—Extend your arm in line with your shoulder
and make a circular movement in the direction required.</p>

<p>“<i>Incline.</i>”—Extend your arm in line with your shoulder
and make a turn with your body in the direction required.</p>


<h4 class="center">Observation</h4>

<p><i>Stalking.</i>—A Scout has to be sharp at seeing things if
she is going to be any good as a Scout. She has to notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
every little track and every little sign, and it is this studying
of tracks and following them out and finding out
their meaning which we include under the name of stalking.
For instance, if you want to find a bird’s-nest you
have to stalk. That is to say, you watch a bird flying into
a bush and guess where its nest is, and follow it up and
find the nest. With some birds it is a most difficult thing
to find their nests; take, for instance, the skylark or the
snipe. But those who know the birds, especially the
snipe, will recognise their call. The snipe when she is
alarmed gives quite a different call from when she is
happy and flying about. She has a particular call when
she has young ones about. So that those who have
watched and listened and know her call when they hear
it know pretty well where the young ones are or where
the nest is and so on.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 511px;">
<img src="images/i_076.jpg" width="511" height="142" alt="Deer; sheep; wolk and fox tracks" />
<div class="caption">A few tracks which you may see some day.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Tracking.</i>—The native hunters in most wild countries
follow their game by watching for tracks on the
ground, and they become so expert at seeing the slightest
sign of a footmark on the ground that they can follow
up their prey when an ordinary civilized man can
see no sign whatever. But the great reason for looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
for signs and tracks is that from these you can read a
meaning. It is exactly like reading a book. You will
see the different letters, each letter combining to make
a word, and the words then make sense; and there are
also commas and full-stops and colons; all of these alter
the meaning of the sense. They are all little signs which
one who is practised and has learnt reading makes into
sense at once, whereas a savage who has never learned
could make no sense of it at all. And so it is with
tracking.</p>

<p><i>Reading Signs.</i>—As you know a soldier Scout in war
can only get his information about the enemy by watching
for the smallest signs both on the ground and in the
far distance. In the war of Texas against Mexico in
the last century, it was very important that the general
commanding the Mexican Army should be captured when
the defeat of that army was accomplished by the Texans.
He had disappeared; but some of the Scouts of the Texan
force were out scouting for the enemy when they saw in
the distance some deer were suddenly startled by something
they could not see and ran away. The Texan
Scouts were at once suspicious, and went to the spot as
fast as they could. There they found a soldier of the
Mexicans evidently trying to escape. When they caught
him and opened his tunic they found underneath he was
wearing a silk shirt, which was not usual with a private
in the Army. They took him to Headquarters, and there
found that he was the Commander-in-Chief of the Mexican
Army, trying to escape disguised as a soldier. And
had it not been that they had noticed the deer being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
startled, it is probable that they would not have caught
him.</p>

<p><i>Sherlock Holmesing.</i>—In just the same way detectives,
when they are following up a crime, have to act on the
very smallest clues, and if they did not use their wits and
notice these the criminal would probably escape.</p>

<p>Well, I want Girl Scouts to learn to be almost like
detectives in their sharpness in noticing small signs and
reading the meaning of them, not merely for the purpose
of studying animals and birds, but also for studying
their human fellow creatures.</p>

<p>It is by noticing small signs of distress or poverty in
people that you can often help them in the best way. Generally
those people who most need help are the ones
who hide their distress; and if you are clever and notice
little signs such as unhappiness, you can then give
them or offer them help in some way or other. In this
way you learn sympathy for fellow-creatures—not
merely to be a friend of animals, but also to be a friend
of your fellow-men in this world; and that again is
carrying out the Girl Scout Law of helping others and
being friendly to all.</p>

<p><i>Nature in the City.</i>—This noticing of small things, especially
in animal life, not only gives you great interest,
but it also gives you great fun and enjoyment in life.
Even if you live in a city you can do a certain amount
of observation of birds and animals. You would think
there is not much fun to be got out of it in a city, and
yet if you begin to notice and know all about the sparrows
you begin to find there is a great deal of character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and amusement to be got out of them, by watching their
ways and habits, their nesting, and their way of teaching
their young ones to fly.</p>

<p><i>Dissecting.</i>—If you go to the butcher’s and get him to
give you a sheep’s foot and you carefully open it up with
a sharp penknife you will see how wonderfully every bone
and joint and sinew is made and fitted into the machine
which enables the foot to move and the sheep to get
along. Then, if you think it out, you know that if you
go away across the sea to the other end of the world,
to Australia or New Zealand, and take a sheep’s foot there
and dissect it in the same way you find it exactly and
identically the same over there as it is here. God’s work
is the same all over the world. People don’t notice these
things and don’t think about them as a rule, and when
you begin to think it out you begin to see what a wonderful
work it is of God’s, who made all these different
animals in their own form, all alike, and yet so different
from the other kind of animals, fishes, or birds. You
begin to realise then what a wonderful Creator has made
the world and all that is in it.</p>



<h3>D. OUR FLAG</h3>

<p>Scouts in uniform will always salute the colors (or
standard of a regiment) when they pass. There are
generally two such standards, one the “Stars and
Stripes,” and the other the “Regimental Colors.”</p>

<p>The Army and Government buildings fly the stars and
stripes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">Description of the American Flag</h4>

<p>The flag to-day has thirteen alternate stripes of red
and white, with a blue field in the corner bearing forty-eight
stars. The thirteen stripes symbolize the thirteen
original states, and the stars stand for the states now in
the Union. The five pointed star is used, it is said at
Betsey Ross’s suggestion. This five pointed star is the
seal of King Solomon, and the sign of infinity. Even
the colors of the flag mean something: red stands for
valor, blue for justice, and white for purity.</p>


<h4 class="center">Pledge of Allegiance</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I pledge allegiance to the flag, and to the republic
for which it stands, one nation indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.</span></p>

<p>When you pledge your allegiance make the full salute,
keeping the hand at the brow until you say “flag,” when
you extend the hand, still in the salute position, palm up,
pointing toward the flag. Hold the hand out thus until
the end of the pledge.</p>


<h4 class="center">How to Fly the Flag and Show Respect to It</h4>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>1. The flag should not be hoisted before sunrise nor
allowed to remain up after sunset.</p>

<p>2. At retreat, sunset, civilian spectators should stand
at attention, Scouts may give their salute.</p>

<p>3. When the national colors are passing on parade or
review the spectators should if walking, halt, and
if sitting, rise and stand at attention and uncover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>4. When the flag is flown at half-mast as a sign of
mourning it should be hoisted to full staff at the
conclusion of the funeral. In placing the flag
at half-mast, it should first be hoisted to the top
of the staff and then be lowered to position.
Preliminary to lowering from half-mast it should
first be raised to top.</p>

<p>5. On Memorial Day, May 30th, the flag should fly at
half-mast from sunrise till noon, and at full mast
from noon to sunset.</p>

<p>6. The flag at half-mast is a sign of mourning.</p>

<p>7. The flag flown upside down is a signal of distress.</p>

<p>8. No national flag is ever hung above the flag of another
nation. When the flags of two or more
nations are displayed they should be on separate
staffs or on separate halyards, and on the same
level. In America the Stars and Stripes are
always given the place of honor on the right.</p>

<p>9. An old torn or soiled flag should be destroyed
privately and respectfully, preferably by burning.</p></div>

<p>While making your knots S.T.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>


<h3>Knots</h3>

<p>Strings or ropes are used almost daily by every one
in some form or other, and yet people often break their
nails and teeth gnawing at their own knots to untie them.
Time spent in learning a few simple reliable knots is
not time wasted, but quite the contrary.</p>

<p>To tie a knot seems a very simple thing and yet there
are right and wrong ways of doing it, and Scouts ought
to know the right way. For sometimes even lives depend
on a knot being properly tied, as with sailors or
men in building trades, and in case of fire-rescue.</p>

<p>The right kind of a knot is one which you can tie
easily and be certain it will hold under any normal strain,
and which you can easily undo.</p>

<p>A bad knot called a “granny” is one which slips when
you pull hard, or which gets jammed so tight that you
cannot untie it.</p>

<p>Of course there are several ways of tying the same
knot, and so if your sailor uncle can show you a good
way to make a bowline don’t tell him the one in this
book is the only way.</p>


<h4 class="center">The Parts of a Rope</h4>

<p>The End.</p>

<p>The Bight or Loop, formed by turning the rope back
on itself.</p>

<p>The Standing Part, or long portion of the rope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">Whipping</h4>

<p>Rope ends that ravel are annoying and before working
your scout rope too hard in practicing all these knots
it is a good plan to whip the ends.</p>

<p>This is how you do it. Hold the rope end in your right
hand. Take about 10 inches of twine, make a loop and
lay it parallel on the rope so that the end of the twine
extends about two inches beyond the end of the rope.
Hold it firmly and with your left hand wind the standing
part of your twine around your rope neatly up toward
your right thumb. When you have bound the twine loop
on to the rope for say an inch, then tuck your winding
end through the loop, pull both ends of the twine, and
cut them off close to the rope.</p>

<p>Now you are ready to work. There are two simple
devices which will help you to learn the knots in the
Tenderfoot test more easily, so it is well to master them
first.</p>

<p>One is the</p>


<h4 class="center">Overhand Knot</h4>

<p>which is the very easiest of all to make. It is the first
half of the square knot, and is a part of many other
knots.</p>

<p>Back the end around the standing part and through
the bight and draw tight.</p>

<p>The other is the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">Running Noose</h4>

<p>If you hang out some clothes on the line when there
is a thunderstorm in the air, it will be well to tie up
your clothes line with a slip knot at each end, as clothes
and all can be taken down in a hurry. A slip knot
made in one end of your cord, can be useful when you
want to tie up a big parcel, for you can get a good “purchase”
on the cord; it is also good in hitching a horse
to a post.</p>

<p>Make a bight. Put your thumb and finger through
it and pull up a loop of the free end of the rope.</p>


<h4 class="center">Reef or Square Knot</h4>

<p>The square knot (or reef knot) is the best simple all
round knot, as it will not slip or jam and is easily untied.
It is the safest knot to tie your parcels with when
mailing them. It is also used to join two ropes, mend
the clothes line, and for a hundred other uses. It is
called a reef knot because it is used to reduce the size
of a sail on a boat. As it is flat it is much used in First
Aid, for tying a sling or triangular bandage.</p>

<p>Take an end of rope in each hand. Cross right end
over the left and twist; then the same end (which is
now in your left hand) over the other end, and twist
again. Then pull the standing parts.</p>

<p>If you are left-handed, of course you would naturally
first put your left end over your right. The thing to
remember in tying a square knot is that the ends must
alternate; otherwise you get a “granny,” or “lubber’s”
knot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">Sheet Bend</h4>

<p>The Sheet Bend (or Weaver’s knot) is good to use
when you want to join a thick line to a thin one, or attach
a rope to a loop or ring. They use this knot on
steamboats when the big hawser can’t be thrown on
shore, but a light line can be attached and easily thrown
to the dock. It is a good knot for Scouts to use when
making a guard line to keep back crowds, at a rally for
instance. With this knot you can join your wool when
knitting, and it is an excellent way to attach a fly to a
fishing line.</p>

<p>Make a loop AB with one rope; pass the end, C,
of your other rope through this loop, round both sides
of the loop and down under its own standing part. Pull
firmly.</p>


<h4 class="center">Clove Hitch (or Builder’s Knot)</h4>

<p>The clove hitch is used when fastening two poles together
as in scaffolding, as either end will stand a strain
without slipping either lengthwise or downwards. It is
also used to tie a boat to a stake, or in First Aid to tie on
a splint.</p>

<p>Pass the end around the post, below the standing part;
around the post again, over the standing part, and tuck
it down between the standing part and the turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">Half Hitch</h4>

<p>The half hitch is a very useful thing to know. It is
not really a knot, but a loop used in tying many of the
harder knots. A double half hitch is needed to make a
secure knot and is used for fastening awning ropes, flag
rope, etc. The more it is strained the faster it holds. It
is a simple way of making a rope fast in a hurry, where a
long continued strain is not expected, thus it is used in
tying a boat’s painter, which is not a man but a rope
fastened to the bow of a small boat.</p>


<h4 class="center">Bowline</h4>

<p>A Bowline makes a noose that is permanent, neither
jamming nor slipping. It is useful in hoisting and lowering,
as in case of fire, rescuing from drowning, a painter’s
chair, etc. It is also used in a guard line, as a halter
for animals, or wherever a safe loop is needed.</p>

<p>Take end in right hand: measure with your left sufficient
rope for the loop you want; make a bight in your
left hand and hold it. Now take the end of the rope in
your right hand, put it up through the bight, round the
standing part, and down through the bight again: pulling
the end and both sides of your permanent loop with the
right hand against the standing part in your left hand;
(three against one).</p>


<h4 class="center">Sheepshank</h4>

<p>A scout would not waste a rope by cutting it but would
shorten it by making a sheepshank. This will stand a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
great strain without slipping, but will loosen when held
slack.</p>

<p>Lay the rope out straight. Cross your hands and take
hold of the rope. Take up the slack by drawing your
hands past each other. Hold the three parts of the
rope between the loop and the end, and put it over the
loop, leaving sufficient loop sticking out so the half hitch
won’t slip off it; then pull. Do the same at the other end,
and put it over the loop, leaving sufficient loop sticking
out so the half hitch won’t slip off it; then pull.
It can be untied by a quick jerk of the outside ropes forming
the bights. To shorten a rope permanently this way,
pass the ends through the loops, and the knot will hold
for any length of time.</p>


<h4 class="center">Fisherman’s Knot</h4>

<p>This knot is used to tie two unequal thicknesses of
rope. It gets its name from the fact that it is always
employed in joining silkworm gut for fishing purposes.</p>

<p>Lay the two ropes parallel, the ends pointing different
ways. Tie an overhand knot on rope one with the end
of rope two, and then tie an overhand knot on rope two
with the end of rope one. Now pull the standing parts
and the knots will jam against each other and remain
firm. To untie, pull the short ends apart, and then
loosen.</p>

<p>When a girl has passed her Tenderfoot test, she is
ready to become a full-fledged Scout. She pays to Headquarters
her registration fee, 25 cents, and receives the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
registration card which is a sort of certificate of membership
and shows that her name is registered at Headquarters.
Now she is entitled to wear the uniform. And
more than all, she makes her Scout promise solemnly before
the troop, and thus becomes one of the Scout sisterhood.
This is not an appropriate occasion on which to
admit the public, or to make any great show or fuss.</p>



<h3>F. DRILL AND EXERCISE</h3>

<p>Scouts learn drill to enable them to be moved quickly
from one point to another in good order. Drill also sets
them up, and makes them smart and quick.</p>

<p>It strengthens the muscles which support the body, and
by keeping the body upright the lungs and heart get plenty
of room to work, and the inside organs are kept in the
proper position for good digestion of food, and so on. A
slouching position, on the other hand, depresses all the
organs, and prevents them doing their work properly, so
that a stooping person is generally weak and often ill.
Growing girls are very apt to slouch, and should therefore
do all they can to get out of the habit by plenty of
physical exercises and drill.</p>

<p>Stand upright when you are standing, and when you
are sitting down sit upright, with your back well into
the back part of the chair.</p>

<p>On the word “Alert,” the Scout stands upright with
both feet together, hands hanging naturally at the sides,
fingers straight, and looking straight to her front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>A Scout will never build up a healthy, sound body if
she is not prudent about her health. Elder girls can
easily help the younger ones by leading them to tell of
their state, and should urge them not to go long marches
if they are not fit, or allow their feet to remain damp
or cold at such times, as it is very bad for them. They
may not feel it at the time, but it may lead to illnesses
years afterwards. It is their duty to promote their
health and to nurse it into a good sound condition, which
will make them hardy in after life.</p>

<h3>Scout Setting Up Exercises</h3>

<h4>I. Positions</h4>

<p>1. <i>Standing:</i> Feet parallel, few inches apart. Stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
erect, top of head high (note: top of head is above ears.
Forehead is not the top), chin parallel with floor, arms
easy at side. The ears, shoulders, hips and ankles
should be in a straight line, weight over ankles.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sitting:</i> Keep back straight in sitting, lower back
against the back of the chair, and feet on the floor.
Note: Arm stretch positions named in exercises</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>When doing exercises, remember always to keep good
standing position. Execute the exercises in brisk rhythm,
without jerks. Repeat each several times, but not so
much that it tires you.</p>

<h4>II. Breathing</h4>

<p>1. Arms from downward through forward, to upward
stretch counting “one.” Arms down counting “two.”
Take deep breath as arms go up, and breathe out as arms
come down.</p>

<p>2. Arms from downward through forward, to upward,
counting “one,” to side stretch, counting “two,” taking
full breath, accenting “two” with side stretch. Down
to side counting “three.”</p>

<p>Count while doing these exercises, accent on “<i>one</i>.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<h4>III. Arms</h4>

<p>1. From downward to side stretch counting “one,” return
to downward counting “two.”</p>

<p>2. From side to upward stretch counting “one” (look
up), return to side, counting “two.”</p>

<p>3. From downward to forward stretch, counting
“one” (don’t slump), return to down, counting “two.”</p>

<p>4. From arms easy, at side, to down stretch, counting
“one” (don’t hump), return to arms easy, counting
“two.”</p>

<p>5. Arms easy, turn palms out, expanding chest and
flattening shoulder blades, stretching down, counting
“one,” return to arms easy, counting “two.”</p>

<p>6. Elbows, on shoulder line, and bent, palms horizontal,
tips of middle fingers together, thumb touching
chest. Move elbows back, flattening shoulder blades, finger
tips separating (thumbs make a line outward on
chest), counting “one,” return, counting “two.”</p>

<p>7. From last position, elbows bent, stretch arms, sideways,
backwards, counting “one,” return, counting
“two.”</p>

<p>8. Arms upward stretch, close to ear, body bent continuously
side to side. (Do not twist.)</p>

<h4>IV. Legs</h4>

<p>(These exercises cannot be done in stiff shoes.)</p>

<p>1. From good standing position, roll feet outward,
weight on outside of feet, toes curled in, counting “one,”
return counting “two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Alternate foot stretch. Foot stretch is done by
raising the heel, bending the knee, the toes and ball of
foot remaining on floor. Count “one,” “two,” one
count for each foot.</p>

<p>3. Alternate foot stretch, at same time bending the
knee, of weight bearing leg, count as in ex. 2. Keep
body straight, hips steady.</p>

<p>4. Double knee bend (bend both knees, raising heels,
keeping back straight). The knees should bend straight
forward over the feet. Count “one” on bend, “two”
on return.</p>

<p>5. Alternate backward kick, bending at knee only,
counting as in ex. 2.</p>

<p>6. Same as exercise 5 in double quick time. (This is
running in place.)</p>

<p>7. Alternate front high knee bend, raising foot from
floor. Count as in ex. 2. Keep body straight.</p>

<p>8. Same as exercise 7, in double quick time.</p>

<p>9. Deep double knee bend, raising heels from floor,
bringing arms from downward to side stretch with the
bend. (This helps to keep balance.)</p>

<p>10. Arms upward stretch, body bent front, hands
touching floor.</p>

<h4>V. From Lying Position</h4>

<p>1. Legs alternately upward stretch, making right angle
with the body.</p>

<p>2. Same exercise both legs together.</p>

<p>3. Same as exercise 2, letting feet go back over head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: The best time to take these exercises is before dressing
in the morning or the last thing at night before going to bed.
Corsets should never be worn during exercises where the arms
are raised above the height of the shoulders. No matter how
loose they may be, it causes actual injury. Keep watch and
see that the feet remain parallel. The tendency with most people
is for them to turn out.</p></div>

<p>A New England farmer’s wife was baking several

marked some T. M. for “’tis mince” and the rest she
marked T. M. for “’tain’t mince.” When you are reading
this book you will now and then see two mysterious

<h3>Tenderfoot Investiture</h3>

<p>The Captain calls “Fall in.” The troop is formed in
a horse shoe, with the Captain and the Lieutenant in the
gap. When ordered to come forward by the Captain
the Patrol Leader brings the Tenderfoot to be invested
to the center, where they stand facing the Captain.</p>

<p>The Captain then asks: “Do you know what your
honor means?” The Tenderfoot replies: “Yes, it
means that I can be trusted to be truthful and honest”
(or words to that effect).</p>

<p>Captain: “Can I trust you on your honor to do your
duty to God and to your country, to help other people at
all times, and to obey the Scout Law.”</p>

<p>Tenderfoot: “On my honor I will try to do my duty
to God and to my country, to help other people at all times,
and to obey the Scout Law.”</p>

<p>The Captain then says: “I trust you, on your honor,
to keep this promise.”</p>

<p>While the recruit is making her promises aloud, all
the Scouts remember their own promises, and vow anew
to keep them.</p>

<p>The Captain orders: “Invest,”—and pins on her trefoil
badge, explaining that it is her Scout’s life. If, for
misbehavior her trefoil or life has to be taken from
her, she becomes a dead Scout for the time the Captain
orders—a day or a week—and is in disgrace. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
badge may be worn at all times, but the uniform is worn
only when the patrol meets.</p>

<p>The new Scout is then initiated into the mysteries of
the secret passwords, “Be Prepared” (said backwards),
or “Little Friend of all the World.”</p>

<p>The Scout should salute the Captain, when she gives
her her badge.</p>

<p>The lieutenant hands the new Tenderfoot her registration
card, and her hat. (This part of the ceremony may
be omitted if desired.)</p>

<p>Captain orders: “About Face”—“Salute”—</p>

<p>Tenderfoot faces the troop, who give her the full salute
to welcome her into the troop, and then she and her
Patrol Leader march back to their places.</p>

<p>Now the Scout is a regular member of one of the
Patrols in the troop. A Patrol is a group of six or eight
Scouts who work together as comrades under a girl who
is the Patrol Leader. The Leader has an assistant called
a Corporal. All Scouts must obey the Leader and Corporal.</p>

<p>Each troop is called after a bird or flower. When the
Scouts first started troops they were only called after
flowers but there were many girls who felt that though
a flower is very pretty and gives out a sweet influence
round it, it doesn’t last long, nor does it “hustle around
and do things”; they wanted something more active as
their emblem. So now a troop can choose which it likes,
a bird, or a flower, or tree or shrub.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 180px;">
<img src="images/i_097.jpg" width="180" height="155" alt="pennant flag with flower" />
</div>

<p>The troop may have a flag, which has the number of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
troop on it, and besides this each Patrol
Leader may have a small flag, ten
inches deep, on a staff, with the crest
of her troop in cloth stitched on to it
on both sides.</p>

<p>Each member of the troop wears
an emblem badge sewn over her left pocket flap, and a
shoulder knot of the colors chosen by her troop.</p>

<p>Every Scout is expected to know all about the life history
of the emblem of her troop. If it is a flower, she
should know what it looks like, when and where it
blooms, and she should if possible grow it herself. If
the emblem is a bird the Scout should know what it
looks like, its call or song, its food, where to look for its
nest, the color of its eggs and time of migration.</p>

<h4 class="center">A Cuckoo Patrol</h4>

<p>A jay is a showy, gaudy kind of bird and, like her
bigger friend the peacock, has a rasping, raucous voice,
and she eats other birds’ eggs, and generally does more
harm than good in the world. There are human jays and
peacocks, but you won’t find them among the Scouts.
The English cuckoo is a curious bird of another kind.
She makes herself out to look somewhat like a hawk,
and somewhat like a dove, you don’t know whether she
is very bold or very peaceful; at any rate she lets you
know that she’s there. She uses her voice freely. But
she’s a lazy creature, does not bother to make a nest of
her own, but goes and puts her eggs in other birds’ nests—rather
deceitful, because she often makes her eggs
match those in the nest she is using—gives them all the
trouble of bringing up her young ones. She leaves them
and goes off South in July, before her offspring can fly
with her. In fact, she is a fraud, she imitates others
and blusters about a lot for a short time, but she does
not do any real work.</p>

<p>Sometimes there have been imitation Girl Scouts, who
dressed themselves up in our uniform, gave themselves
similar badges, made themselves unpleasantly conspicuous,
but never really grasped the Scout spirit nor did the
Scout work, and so they won for themselves the name of
cuckoo. So don’t belong to a cuckoo patrol.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>If you are the Scout you ought to be, you will start
to work to make your own patrol the best in the troop
and to make yourself the best Scout in the patrol—for
smartness, for efficiency, and for happiness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>The Second Class badge is a green trefoil embroidered
on a tan background, and is worn on the left sleeve above
the elbow.</p>

<p>The occasion of awarding Second Class badges gives
Scouts an opportunity to arrange a ceremony for themselves
following more or less the lines of the Tenderfoot
investiture.</p>



<h3>SIGNALLING</h3>


<h4 class="center">General Service Code</h4>

<p>The General Service Code, also called the Continental
and the International Morse Code, is the code used by
the Army and Navy, cables, wireless telegraphy, and all
commercial communications except short distance telegraphing,
within the United States. Avoid the term International
Morse as both these names apply to other
codes. The International code is made up of flags each
one of which stands for a letter or other signal, and the
Morse is used of the American Morse or telegraph alphabet.
There is Visual signalling by hand flag torches,
lanterns, etc.; and Sound signalling with buzzer, whistle,
drum, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">Signalling by Single Flag, or Wig-wagging</h4>

<p>The flag used is square with a smaller square of another
color in the center. It may be either white with
the smaller square red, or red with white. A good size
for Girl Scouts to use is 24 inches square with the center
8 inches square, and the pole 42 inches long.</p>

<p>There are but three motions to make with the flag, and
all start from <small>POSITION</small>, which means that the signaller
stands erect facing the person with whom she is communicating
holding the flag perpendicularly in front of
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span>—To make a dot, swing the flag down to the right
and bring it back to Position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dash.</span>—To make a dash, swing the flag down to the
left, and bring it back again to Position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Front.</span>—The third motion is front, made by swinging
the flag down directly in front and returning to Position.</p>

<p>In order to keep the flag from “fouling” when making
the motions, make, by a turn of the wrist, a sort of figure
8 with the end of the staff, as shown in the picture.</p>

<p>In learning signalling try to master these motions first;
then it is easy to put them together in letters. Make no
pause between dots or dashes in a single letter, but have
a continuous motion.</p>

<p>Indicate the end of a Letter by a distinct pause at
Position.</p>

<p>Indicate the end of a Word by one Front.</p>

<p>Indicate the end of a Sentence by two Fronts.</p>

<p>Indicate the end of a Message by three Fronts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Many Scouts have found it easier to learn the motions
required in flag signalling with a light stick about
18 or 24 inches long; you will be surprised to see how
simple it is to handle a flag, when the motions have been
mastered with a stick.</p>

<p>Don’t try for speed. Accuracy is the most important
thing, for unless the letters are accurately made they
may be confused and your message will be read as something
quite different from what you intended. Fall into
a regular easy rhythm. Speed will come with practice.
When signalling a message go slowly enough for the
receiver to read it.</p>


<h4 class="center">Semaphore</h4>

<p>The “Semaphore” is really a machine, with two arms
which may be moved into various positions to indicate
letters. It is especially used on railroads. The semaphore
code may also be employed by a person using two
flags. It is the quickest method of flag signalling but is
only available for comparatively short distances, seldom
over a mile, unless extra large flags are used, or there
are some extraordinary conditions of backgrounds, atmosphere,
etcetera.</p>

<p>The semaphore code is not adapted to all sorts of uses
as is the general service code, but for very quick communications
over short distances it is most useful.</p>

<p>The regulation Semaphore flag is 18 inches square,
divided diagonally into two triangles, a red and a white,
with the red one fastened to a staff which is 24 inches
long. The staff must be carefully held, to move in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
piece with the arm, as a “break” at the wrist would make
an entirely different angle.</p>

<p>Pass the arms smoothly from one letter to another.
Don’t let them “flop” about between letters. Hold each
letter long enough so that it is distinct. At the end of a
word make “Interval” hands crossed downward in front
of body, right over left. Indicate the end of the sentence
by one “chop-chop”—made by placing both arms
at the right, horizontal, and moving them up and down
in cutting motion. Indicate end of the message by three
“chop-chops.” While signalling maintain fixed position,
head upright.</p>

<p>Be accurate in making the letters. It is the angle between
your arms that counts. Speed will soon come with
practice. Don’t look in a mirror, or you will get it all
backwards.</p>


<h4 class="center">Signalling with a Lantern</h4>

<p>The motions used in signalling with a lantern are very
like those with the single flag. For Position, hold a
lantern directly in front of you; for a dot swing it to
the right and back; for a dash swing it to the left and
back; and for Front move it up and down in a vertical
line, directly in front of you. You should have a stationary
light, in front of your feet, as a point of reference
for the various motions.</p>


<h4 class="center">Signalling with a Flash Light</h4>

<p>Use a short flash for a dot, and a long steady flash for
dash. Pause between letters, longer pause between
words, still longer at end of sentence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">Signalling by Sound</h4>

<p>Whistle:—Use a short blast for a dot, and a long
steady blast for a dash. Indicate the end of a letter
by a short pause, end of word by a longer pause, and the
end of a sentence by a still longer pause.</p>

<p>On the telegraph instrument the dot makes one distinct
click. The dash a double click. Try and you will
see. Practice tapping with a pencil, a stick or even your
fingers, to make the ear familiar with the sound; single
tap for a dot, double for a dash.</p>

<p>The code must be absolutely mastered so that you know
a letter the minute you see it. Counting off dots and
dashes, is a sign of a beginner who doesn’t yet know her
code. It is a bad plan to try to learn code by writing
it out. You never use it written, and you should learn
it as you are going to use it with flags, lights or sounds.</p>

<p>From the very first, practice reading as well as sending.
It is harder to do, and requires more practice.</p>

<p>If another Scout facing you will signal the same letter
at the same time you are signalling to her, then you read
and send that letter simultaneously and thus recognize
the letter when receiving a message.</p>

<p>You will find it a curious fact that it is easier to learn
the letters by signalling them in words and messages, than
by trying to master them singly, in their order in the
alphabet.</p>

<p>A good way to learn the general service code is this.
Learn first the four letters made all of dots, and then
the three made all of dashes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Sort of morse code">
<tr><td align="left">E</td><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">I</td><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;..</td><td align="left">T</td><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;-</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">S</td><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;...</td><td align="left">M</td><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;--</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">H</td><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">O</td><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;---</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Fix these in your mind by using them in words like—to,
she, some, time, etc. Then take the words “Girl
Scouts” and learn them. With the new letters in these
added to the dot and dash letters you can make any number
of words,—stone, lost, curl, etc. To these add “Be
Prepared,” “Come quickly,” “Joyful Scouts never are
lazy” and now you can signal all the Scout laws, and
you know all the letters of the alphabet except w, x and z.
You may learn these separately or in “Buzzing bees make
wax.”</p>

<p>The semaphore code may be learned in the same way,
and Scouts can easily make up other sentences on the same
principle, to suit the semaphore code.</p>

<p><i>Games.</i>—There are a great many games which will
give practice in the signalling tests and the signs. Perhaps
a simple one to start with is “<i>Follow the Trail</i>.”</p>

<p>A party of cowboys are to start off for a long journey
across the prairie. They are expecting a party of their
mates to follow them in a week’s time. So they agree
to make scout signs and leave messages all the way. The
Scouts, having divided into two parties, one starts away
across the fields and woods—preferably along a path or
track. They make arrows pointing in the direction they
are following, either on the ground or on fences or stones.
They hide messages, written on paper or on white stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
or pieces of wood, saying how they are getting on; where
water may be found; or warning their pals of various
dangers. “Don’t follow this road,” (X) is also made
when necessary. Meanwhile the second party of Scouts
start (having given the cowboys ten minutes’ start) <i>not</i>
as the expected friends, but as a party of Indians, who
have picked up the trail and are hot on the track of the
“palefaces.” They follow, destroying all the cowboys’
tracks and signs, and reading their messages. Indian
scouts may be sent on, singly (fast runners) to reconnoitre,
and report on the number and deportment of the
cowboys. But the Indian scout does this at her own peril.
If she is <i>seen</i> by the palefaces she becomes their prisoner,
and must go on with them. (Any cowboy seeing an
enemy scout calls out her name, whereupon the Indian
<i>must</i> play fair and surrender.) The palefaces eventually
run short of provisions, at the end of a half a mile (or
more) and are obliged to halt. Believing Indians to be
following them, they take cover. The Indians, finding
that the trail has come to an end, search for the cowboys
(<i>seeing</i> and calling out the name being equal to killing),
but any paleface who manages to creep out of her cover
and <i>touch</i> an Indian before she is seen herself kills her
(puts her out of action). The game is won by the party
having the largest number of survivors when the Captain
blows her whistle.</p>

<p>A game by which reading Morse may be practised is as
follows:</p>

<p>About twelve Scouts can play at it. The Scouts each
choose a letter of the alphabet. This (printed large in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
ink on a card) is pinned on her chest. Each then is allotted
a place to stand, in a field or open space (her distance
away can be arranged by the Captain to suit the
capability of the Scout). The Captain stands so that
the Scouts are before her in a large semicircle, and all can
see her. Her object is to signal in Morse and move the
Scouts—two changing places (as in the game of “General
Post”). If she sends A, P,—A and P each start
forward, and run across the field, taking up each other’s
positions. This means that every Scout must have her
eyes fixed very attentively on the Captain. Each Scout
has five “<i>lives</i>.” If she starts forward when her letter
has not been sent she loses one “life”: if she fails to start
before the Captain has counted six from signalling the
second letter, she loses a life. At the end of a given time,
Scouts who have lost least lives are considered the winners.
Of course all <i>speaking</i> must be strictly forbidden
during this game. The Captain must arrange to give each
Scout an equal number of chances to move. It should not
be played too long at a time. More than twelve should
not play, or the letters cannot each be sent often enough
to keep up the interest. This game teaches the Scouts
to <i>read</i> Semaphore, and also absolute concentration and
alertness. (Notice that this concentration is not an undue
strain, as it is relaxed while the two Scouts are running
across to change places.) If the Leaders are sufficiently
good signallers they may be allowed to do the sending,
the Captain acting as umpire and scorer.</p>

<p>It is difficult to describe any actual games which will
incorporate signals by smoke, sound, movement, etc. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
picnics and outings in the country may be treated as one
great “make believe.” The party becomes a band of
marooned sailors, an exploring expedition, survivors from
a torpedoed ship, or nurses on the battlefield, and the
picnic turns into a bivouac, the fire being used to send
smoke signals (either to another pack or to a party sent
out for this purpose). All communications with this
party should be carried on by signal—flag, whistle, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 634px;">
<img src="images/i_108.jpg" width="634" height="270" alt="two people sitting in front of lean-to by a campfire" />
<div class="caption">Survivors from a torpedoed ship.</div>
</div>

<p>For simple practice of the sound and movement signals
the Scouts should be scattered over a field, while the Captain
gives the signal, which is to be obeyed promptly.
She should watch carefully, and might call out the name
(or number) of the Scout last in obeying the order. This
will make for alertness. It would be a good plan to
arrange some “as you were” signal, to give after each
command has been obeyed (say, two sharp notes).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>


<h3>WOODCRAFT: OR, KNOWLEDGE OF
ANIMALS AND NATURE</h3>

<p><i>Habits of Animals.</i>—If you live in the country it is, of
course quite easy to observe and watch the habits of all
sorts of animals great and small. But if you are in a
town there are many difficulties to be met with. But at
the same time if you can keep pets of any kind, rabbits,
rats, mice, dogs or ponies you can observe and watch
their habits and learn to understand them well; but generally
for Scouts it is more easy to watch birds, because
you see them both in town and country; and especially
when you go into camp or on walking tours you can observe
and watch their habits, especially in the spring-time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 221px;">
<img src="images/i_109.jpg" width="221" height="242" alt="baby bird" />
<div class="caption">Training young ones to fly.</div>
</div>

<p>Then it is that you see the old birds making their nests,
hatching out their eggs and bringing up their young; and
that is of course the most interesting time for watching
them. A good observant scout will get to know the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
kinds of birds by their cry, by their appearance, and
by their way of flying. She will also get to know where
their nests are to be found, what sort of nests they are,
what are the colors of the eggs and so on. And also how
the young appear. Some of them come out fluffy, others
covered with feathers, others with very little on at all.
The young pigeon, for instance, has not feathers at all,
whereas a young moorhen can swim about as soon as it
comes out of the egg; while chickens run about and hunt
flies within a few minutes; and yet a sparrow is quite useless
for some days and is blind, and has to be fed and
coddled by his parents.</p>

<p>Then it is an interesting sight to see the old birds training
their young ones to fly by getting up above them and
flapping their wings a few times until all the young ones
imitate them. Then they hop from one twig to another,
still flapping their wings, and the young ones follow suit
and begin to find that their wings help them to balance;
and finally they jump from one branch to another for
some distance so that the wings support them in their
effort. The young ones very soon find that they are able
to use their wings for flying, but it is all done by degrees
and by careful instruction.</p>

<p>If you think there is no natural history or observation
of bird life possible in the city, get hold of that delightful
book “Lives of the Hunted,” by Ernest Seton Thompson.
There you will find a ripping story of Randy and Biddy,
the two sparrows, who built a nest between them after
wonderful differences of opinion. Randy started to make
it of sticks, and Biddy almost declined to live with him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
consequence, so he carefully pulled every stick out and
dropped them on the pavement and gave in to her preferring
for hay and straw. Then they used string. But
when she brought feathers he drew the line and argued
the point. However, the story should be read to be enjoyed
as it stands in that book.</p>

<p>Then a large number of our birds do not live all the
year round in England, but they go off to Southern climes
such as Africa when the winter comes on. In September
you will see the migrating birds collecting to go away, the
starlings in their crowds and the swallows for the South,
and the warblers, the flycatchers, and the swifts. And yet
about the same time the large are arriving, so there is a
good deal of travelling to and from among the birds in the
air at all times of the year.</p>

<p><i>How to draw.</i>—By the way, talking of birds, every
Scout ought to be able to draw one.</p>

<p>First, of course, you lay the egg. Then put a watch on
it, with the second dial to show the time. But before you
put in the hands it becomes a bird. Then you add the
outline, thus:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;">
<img src="images/i_111.jpg" width="417" height="239" alt="diagram of drawing  a bird" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>Try it yourself. It is quite easy.</p>

<p><i>Reptiles.</i>—There is a lot of interest to be got out of
watching reptiles, such as frogs, which begin as tadpoles,
eating weeds, and gradually lose their tails and gills,
which they begin with, and end up as frogs, eating worms
and slugs as food.</p>

<p><i>Insects.</i>—Insects, too, are very interesting little people
when you get to know their ways and habits. Among
them you can generally find moths, ants, gnats, butterflies,
bees, beetles, ladybirds, and all such. Though most girls
do not care very much about them, Scouts who have
studied them get to like them, even spiders and daddy-longlegs,
and to take a close interest in them.</p>

<p>Caddis worms, for instance, build the most beautiful
houses of mosaic work, all formed of tiny stones and bits
of shell glued on to a silken lining which the caddis
worms make themselves.</p>

<p>The caddis worm has extraordinary jaws which he can
fold up when they are in the way, and he can also push
himself along in the water by squirting out a strong jet
of water all round him. A caddis worm is really only the
larva of a large sort of dragon fly; so when he wants to
change into a winged insect, he cleverly spins a silken
door across each end of his tubular house, and fixes it on
to the stalk of a plant near the water. Then he waits till
his wings have grown, and at last he crawls out and runs
up the plant out of the water, and flies away into the sunshine.</p>

<p>Butterfly-hunting is a most exciting pastime. You go
out with your net and your box, and chase the pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
creatures over field and swamp, and hedge and ditch. If
possible, try not to spoil the wings, and then keep them
alive in a cage or a greenhouse. You can keep the eggs
they lay, and bring up a large family for next year. You
can make your own net if you buy a yard of stout wire,
and bend it round, and bind the ends tightly and neatly
to a cane or stick.</p>

<p>Make your net long enough to hang across the wire,
when your butterfly is caught, thus:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/i_113.jpg" width="412" height="134" alt="net on pole" />
</div>

<p>Examine the wings carefully with a magnifying glass,
as the tiny scarlet and yellow feathers are easily rubbed
off and spoilt, especially if the creature flutter about.</p>

<p>Personally I don’t use a net; I catch them by drawing
their portraits in my sketch-book. It saves a lot of
trouble to them and to me.</p>

<p><i>Trees.</i>—Then Scouts should know all about the different
trees in their country and know their names by their
appearance in summer and also in winter; and what they
are good for, and what their leaves are like and their
flower or their fruit as the case may be. It helps you
very much in camp to know what kind of wood burns well,
such as pine wood or sugar bush or gum tree. Also which
kinds of wood are best for carving, for making walking
sticks, for painting on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>The common trees which a Scout should know by
sight are:</p>


<ul class="smallin"><li>Oak</li>
<li>Elm</li>
<li>Plane</li>
<li>Cedar</li>
<li>Fir</li>
<li>Poplar</li>
<li>Pine</li>
<li>Sycamore</li>
<li>Larch</li>
<li>Willow</li>
<li>Holly</li>
<li>Horse Chestnut</li>
<li>Ash</li>
<li>Lime</li>
<li>Beech</li>
<li>Birch</li>
<li>Spanish Chestnut</li>
<li>Walnut</li>
</ul>


<p><i>Flowers.</i>—Flowers, of course, interest girls as much as
any kind of plant, because they are easily cultivated, and
every Scout ought to know the names of most of the
common flowers and to understand how they live and how
they ought to be treated; when to plant them and when
to expect them coming up; and how they produce their
seed and how they send it about and re-plant themselves
in different parts near them.</p>

<p>For instance, if you have a magnifying glass you can
examine a dandelion seed with it. Few things are more
beautiful. It is much the same as a thistle seed, tucked
away cleverly till it is ripe, and it all opens into a delicate
feathery kind of parachute each carrying a seed. This
blows about with the wind many miles before it actually
falls to the ground and there sows itself.</p>

</div>

<p>Most flowers seem to have the wish to scatter their seed
far away from them. Even the modest little violet sows
its seed out of a little boat-shaped pod with great force and
a loud report to a distance of some three feet; and so
does the iris, the pansy, the wall-flower, and many others.
Many flowers and plants produce berries and fruits which
are good to eat, others produce those that are poisonous;
and a Scout should know which are which, since when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a><br /><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
are in camp some of them may come in very useful,
whereas others which look tempting to eat may cause you
a great deal of trouble and illness.</p>


<h4 class="center">Eatable Plants</h4>

<p>But especially you ought to know what kind of plants
are useful to you in providing you with food. Supposing
you were out in a jungle without any food, as very
often happens; if you knew nothing about plants you
would probably die of starvation, or of poisoning, from
not knowing which fruit or roots were wholesome and
which dangerous to eat.</p>

<p>There are numbers of berries, nuts, roots, barks, and
leaves that are good to eat.</p>

<p>The same with crops of different kinds of corn and
seed, vegetable roots, and even grasses and vetches. Seaweed
is much eaten in Ireland and Scotland. Such as
laver, sloke, dulse, ulva, etc.</p>

<p>No less than fifteen kinds of fungi (that’s the plural of
fungus!), or mushrooms, are good to eat if you can only
tell them from the poisonous kinds.</p>

<p>Dandelions, nettles, rose berries, bracken roots, lime
buds, and many other common plants make useful foods.</p>

<p>But you have to know which is which when you see
them, and then know how to cook or prepare them.</p>

<p>Woodland cooking is great fun when you care to do it.</p>


<h4 class="center">Nature Study in Towns</h4>

<p>Many people seem to think that you cannot get Nature
study unless you are out in the fields or woods studying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the animals or noticing the plants, but you can do a great
deal in town and even in your own room with others, or
even by yourself.</p>

<p>For one thing, just think of the wonder of your own
eye if you study it in the glass, and the delicacy of its construction;
how it is like a bubble which a very slight blow
would destroy altogether. Then from the eye go the
nerves carrying back what it has seen of visible things to
the brain, where the thoughts which are invisible take it
over, the thought then gives the desire or the power to
move. That is to say, your eyes show you something
on the table and the invisible thought comes in your mind
that you would like to catch hold of it, and the thought
then makes the material sinews of your arm get to work
and grasp it.</p>

<p>You cannot see your thought, but you know it is there,
and you see the result of your thought when you grasp
the thing. In the same way God is not visible, but all
the same he is there, and you see the result when you do a
good act. Sometimes you don’t do that good act, or you
may do one that is not suggested by God. You may well
feel ashamed when this happens and refuse to let yourself
do it again. Therefore, try and think before doing a
thing and ask yourself the question “Does God want me
to do this?” If the reply in your mind says “Yes,” then
do it; and if it says “No,” then don’t do it. It is not a
difficult thing to live a straight and clean life if you only
<small>REMEMBER</small> to <i>think</i> first and do after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">Stalking</h4>

<p><i>How to Hide Yourself.</i>—When you want to observe
wild animals you have to stalk them, that is, creep up to
them without their seeing or smelling you.</p>

<p>A hunter when he is stalking wild animals keeps himself
entirely hidden, so does the war scout when watching
or looking for the enemy; a policeman does not catch pickpockets
by standing about in uniform watching for them;
he dresses like one of the crowd, and as often as not gazes
into a shop window and sees all that goes on behind him
reflected as if in a looking-glass.</p>

<p>If a guilty person finds himself being watched, it puts
him on his guard, while an innocent person becomes annoyed.
So, when you are observing people, don’t do so
by openly staring at them, but notice the details you want
to at one glance or two, and if you want to study them
more, walk behind them; you can learn just as much from
a back view, in fact more than you can from a front view,
and, unless they are scouts and look round frequently,
they do not know that you are observing them.</p>

<p>War scouts and hunters stalking game always carry out
two important things when they don’t want to be seen.</p>

<p><i>Background.</i>—One is—they <i>take care that the ground
behind them, or trees, or buildings, etc., are of the same
color as their clothes</i>.</p>

<p>And the other is—if an enemy or a deer is seen looking
for them, <i>they remain perfectly still without moving so
long as he is there</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Freezing.</i>”—In that way a scout, even though he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
out in the open, will often escape being noticed. This is
called by scouts “Freezing.”</p>


<h4 class="center">Tracking</h4>

<p>“Sign” is the word used by Scouts to mean any little
details, such as footprints, broken twigs, trampled grass,
scraps of food, old matches, etc.</p>

<p>Any one of you might win the reward of $100 for
tracing the writer of a typewritten paper which nearly
caused the ruin of a large bank. It was noticed by signs
that the writer must have used a Remington machine No.
7, because of the shape of the letters. The type was much
worn, therefore it is supposed the machine was four or
five years old. Now, who bought one at that time?
Then you could see that the letter “o” had a bent bar,
the letter “r” had a faulty spring, and the top of the
capital letter “C” was worn away. So you see that if
you found a machine with all these faults you could trace
the person who used it, from even such very small signs.</p>

<p>Some native Indian trackers were following up the
footprints of a panther that had killed and carried off a
young kid. He had crossed a wide bare slab of rock,
which, of course, gave no mark of his soft feet. The
tracker went at once to the far side of the rock where it
came to a sharp edge; he wetted his finger, and just
passed it along the edge till he found a few kid’s hairs
sticking to it. This showed him where the panther had
passed down off the rock, dragging the kid with him.
Those few hairs were what Scouts call “sign.”</p>

<p>This tracker also found bears by noticing small “sign.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
On one occasion he noticed a fresh scratch in the bark of
a tree, evidently made by a bear’s claw, and on the other
he found a single black hair sticking to the bark of a tree,
which told him that a bear had rubbed against it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 130px;">
<img src="images/i_120.jpg" width="130" height="427" alt="a cout with head twisted round and round" />
<div class="caption">A Scout should have her head screwed on the right way, not
as in this picture.</div>
</div>

<p>One of the most important things that a Scout has to
learn is <i>to let nothing escape her attention</i>; she must notice
small points and signs, and then make out the meaning of
them; but it takes a good deal of practice before a tenderfoot
can get into the habit of really noting everything and
letting nothing escape her eye. It can be learnt just as
well in a town as in the country, provided that your
head is screwed on the right way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>And in the same way you should notice any strange
sound or any peculiar smell, and think for yourself what
it may mean. Unless you learn to notice “sign” you
will have very little of “this and that” to put together,
and so you will be of no use as a Girl Scout. It comes
by practice. Remember a Scout always considers it a
great disgrace if an outsider discovers a thing before she
herself does, whether that thing is far away or close by.</p>

<p>Don’t only look at the path before you, but frequently
turn and look back. Notice the features of the country
behind you, to see what your road will look like in coming
back again.</p>

<p>In the streets of a strange town a Girl Scout will mark
her way by the principal buildings and side-streets, and in
any case she will notice what shops she passes and what is
in their windows; also what vehicles pass her, and such
details as whether the horses’ harness and shoes are all
right; and most especially what people she passes, what
their faces are like, their dress, their boots, and their way
of walking, so that if, for instance, she should be asked by
a policeman, “Have you seen a man with dark overhanging
eyebrows, dressed in a blue suit, going down this
street?” she should be able to give some such answer as
“Yes; he was walking a little lame with the right foot,
wore foreign-looking boots, was carrying a parcel in his
hand; he turned down Gold Street, the second turning
on the left from here, about three minutes ago.”</p>

<p>Information of that kind has often been of the greatest
value in tracing out a criminal, but so many people go
along with their eyes shut and never notice things.</p>

<p>In the story of <i>Kim</i>, by Rudyard Kipling, there is an
account of two boys being taught “observation,” in order
to become detectives by means of a game in which a
trayful of small objects was shown to them for a minute
and was then covered over, and they had to describe all
the things on it from memory.</p>

<p>We will have that game, as it is excellent practice for
Scouts.</p>

<p><i>Details of People.</i>—It is of interest when you are travelling
by train or tram to notice little things about your
fellow-travellers—their faces, dress, way of talking, and
so on—so that you could describe them each pretty accurately
afterwards; and also try and make out from their
appearance and behavior whether they are rich or poor
(which you can generally tell from their boots), and what
is their probable business, whether they are happy, or ill,
or in want of help.</p>

<p>But in doing this you must not let them see you are
watching them, else it puts them on their guard.</p>

<p><i>Reading a Meaning in Sign.</i>—It is said that you can
tell a man’s character from the way he wears his hat.
If it is slightly on one side, the wearer is good-natured; if
it is worn very much on one side, he is a swaggerer; if
on the back of his head, he is bad at paying his debts; if
worn straight on the top, he is probably honest but very
dull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The way a man (or a woman) walks is often a good
guide to his character—witness the fussy, swaggering
little man paddling along with short steps and much arm-action;
the nervous man’s hurried, jerky stride; the slow
slouch of the loafer; the smooth, quick, and silent step of
the Scout, and so on.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 248px;">
<img src="images/i_124.jpg" width="248" height="280" alt="a stout well-dessed man; slouching man in comfy clothes" />
<div class="caption">Judging character by the gait of a man.</div>
</div>

<p>With a little practice in observation you can tell pretty
accurately a man’s character from his dress.</p>

<p>How would you recognize that a gentleman was fond of
fishing? If you see his left cuff with little tufts of cloth
sticking up, you may be sure he fishes. When he takes
his flies off the line he will either stick them into his cap
to dry, or hook them into his sleeve. When dry he pulls
them out, which often tears a thread or two of the
cloth.</p>

<p>It is surprising how much of the sole of the shoes you
can see when behind a person walking—and it is equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
surprising how much meaning you can read from that
shoe. It is said that to wear out soles and heels equally
is to give evidence of business capacity and honesty; to
wear your heels down on the outside means that you are a
person of imagination and love of adventure; but heels
worn down on the inside signify weakness and indecision
of character, and this last sign is more infallible in the
case of man than in that of woman.</p>

<p>Remember how “Sherlock Holmes” met a stranger
and noticed that he was looking fairly well-to-do, in new
clothes with a mourning band on his sleeve, with a
soldierly bearing and a sailor’s way of walking, sunburns,
with tattoo marks on his hands, and he was carrying some
children’s toys in his hand. What would you have supposed
that man to be? Well, Sherlock Holmes guessed
correctly that he had lately retired from the Marines as a
sergeant, that his wife had died, and that he had some
small children at home.</p>

<p><i>Details in the Country.</i>—If you are in the country, you
should notice landmarks—that is, objects which help you
to find your way or prevent you getting lost—such as distant
hills and church towers; and nearer objects, such as
peculiar buildings, trees, gates, rocks, etc.</p>

<p>And remember in noticing such landmarks that you may
want to use your knowledge of them some day for telling
some one else how to find his way, so you must notice
them pretty closely so as to be able to describe them unmistakably
and in their proper order. You must notice
and <i>remember</i> every by-road and footpath.</p>

<p>Remembrance of these things will help you to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
your way by night or in fog when other people are losing
themselves.</p>

<p><i>Using your Eyes.</i>—Let nothing be too small for your
notice—a button, a match, a hair, a cigar ash, a feather,
or a leaf might be of great importance, even a fingerprint
which is almost invisible to the naked eye has often
been the means of detecting a crime.</p>

<p>Not long ago a lady reported to the police that she was
sitting in her room reading quietly in the corner when a
ragged-looking man crept in at the open window, seized
hold of a silver vase, and was in the act of making off
with it when a sound outside disturbed him.</p>

<p>He put down the vase again, ran away across the lawn,
jumped a low hedge, and got away.</p>

<p>Detectives came and examined the ground, but could
find no footmarks even at the spot where the man had
landed from his jump. Then they inspected the vase very
carefully, and examined the fingers of the different people
in the house.</p>

<p>They then reported that nobody except the maid had
handled the vase and that nobody had gone across the
lawn or jumped the hedge.</p>

<p>It was afterwards found that the lady was subject to
delusions, and had imagined the whole thing, but the
detectives had arrived at the same conclusion through
examining the fingermarks and signs.</p>

<p>When out in the country you must keep your eyes
about you and not merely notice small signs close to you,
but other signs far away as well—such as dust flying,
birds startled, unnatural movements of bush or grass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and also keep your ears open for sounds such as cracking
of a twig, dogs suddenly barking and so on.</p>

<p>The battle of Boomplatz, fought by the British against
the Boers, was successful for us partly because Sir
Harry Smith, the Commander, noticed some buck in
the distance suddenly startled and running for no apparent
reason, but his suspicions being aroused he sent scouts
to investigate, and they found a Boer force trying to
form an ambush for him, and he was able to defeat their
aims in consequence.</p>

<p>By night of course you must use your ears instead of
your eyes and practice at this helps to make perfect.</p>

<p>A trained Scout will see little signs and tracks, she puts
them together in her mind, and quickly reads a meaning
from them such as an untrained woman would never arrive
at.</p>

<p>And from frequent practice she gets to read the meaning
at a glance, just as you do a book, without the delay
of spelling out each word, letter by letter.</p>

<p>I was one day, during the Matabele War [<i>show on map</i>]
with a native out scouting near to the Matopo Hills over
a wide grassy plain. Suddenly we crossed a track freshly
made in grass, where the blades of grass were still green
and damp, though pressed down; all were bending one
way, which showed the direction in which the people had
been travelling. Following up the track for a bit it got
on to a patch of sand, and we then saw that it was the
spoor of several women (small feet with straight edge,
and short steps) and boys (small feet, curved edge, and
longer strides), walking, not running, towards the hills,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
about five miles away, where we believed the enemy to be
hiding.</p>

<p>Then we saw a leaf lying about ten yards off the track.
There were no trees for miles, but we knew that trees having
this kind of leaf grew at a village fifteen miles away,
in the direction from which the footmarks were coming.
It seemed likely therefore that the women had come
from that village, bringing the leaf with them, and had
gone to the hills.</p>

<p>On picking up the leaf we found it was damp, and
smelled of native beer. The short steps showed that the
women were carrying loads. So we guessed that according
to the custom they had been carrying pots of native
beer on their heads, the mouths of the pots being stopped
up with bunches of leaves. One of these leaves had fallen
out; but we found it ten yards off the track, which showed
that at the time it fell a wind was blowing. There was
no wind now, i. e., seven o’clock, but there had been some
about five o’clock.</p>

<p>So we guessed from all these little signs that a party
of women and boys had brought beer during the night
from the village 15 miles away, and had taken it to
the enemy on the hills, arriving there soon after six
o’clock.</p>

<p>The men would probably start to drink the beer at
once (as it goes sour in a few hours), and would, by the
time we could get there, be getting sleepy and keeping a
bad look-out, so we should have a favourable chance of
looking at their position.</p>

<p>We accordingly followed the women’s track, found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
enemy, made our observations, and got away with our
information without any difficulty.</p>

<p>And it was chiefly done on the evidence of that one
leaf. So you see the importance of noticing even a little
thing like that.</p>


<h4 class="center">Games in Stalking</h4>

<p><i>Girl Scout Hunting.</i>—One Scout is given time to go
out and hide herself, the remainder then start to find her;
she wins if she is not found, or if she can get back to the
starting-point within a given time without being touched.</p>

<p><i>Dispatch Running.</i>—A Scout is told to bring a note to
a certain spot or house from a distance within a given
time: other hostile Scouts are told to prevent any message
getting to this place, and to hide themselves at
different points to stop the dispatch carrier getting in
with it.</p>

<p>To count as a capture, two Scouts must touch the dispatch
runner before she reaches the spot for delivering
the message.</p>

<p><i>Relay Race.</i>—One patrol pitted against another to see
who can get a message sent a long distance in shortest time
by means of relays of runners or cyclists. The patrol is
ordered out to send in three successive notes or tokens
(such as sprigs of certain plants), from a point, say, two
miles distant or more. The leader in taking her patrol
out to the spot, drops Scouts at convenient distances, who
will then act as runners from one post to the next and
back. If relays are posted in pairs, messages can be
passed both ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Stalking.</i>—Captain acts as a deer—not hiding, but
standing, moving a little now and then if she likes.</p>

<p>Scouts go out to find, and each in her own way tries
to get up to her unseen.</p>

<p>Directly the Captain sees a Scout she directs her to
stand up as having failed. After a certain time the Captain
calls “Time,” all stand up at the spot which they have
reached, and the nearest wins.</p>

<p>The same game may be played to test the Scouts in
stepping lightly—the umpire being blindfolded. The
practice should preferably be carried out where there are
dry twigs lying about, and gravel, etc. The Scout may
start to stalk the blind enemy at 100 yards’ distance, and
she must do it fairly fast—say, in one minute and a
half—to touch the blind man before she hears her.</p>

<p><i>Stalking and Reporting.</i>—The umpire places herself
out in the open and sends each Scout or pair of Scouts
away in different directions about half a mile off. When
she waves a flag, which is the signal to begin, they all
hide, and then proceed to stalk her, creeping up and watching
all she does. When she waves the flag again, they
rise, come in, and report each in turn all that she did,
either by handing in a written report or verbally, as may
be ordered. The umpire meantime has kept a look-out
in each direction, and, every time she sees a Scout, she
takes two points off that Scout’s score. She, on her part,
performs small actions, such as sitting down, kneeling up,
looking through glasses, using handkerchief, taking hat
off for a bit, walking round in a circle a few times, to
give Scouts something to note and report about her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Scouts are given three points for each act reported correctly.
It saves time if the umpire makes out a scoring
card beforehand, giving the name of each Scout, and a
number of columns showing each act of her, and what
mark that Scout wins, also a column of deducted marks
for exposing themselves.</p>

<p>The “Spider and Fly” game as described in the English
book “Scouting for Boys” is also a proper one and
useful for training in observation.</p>

<p><i>Plant Race.</i>—The Scouts start off either cycling or on
foot, to go in any direction they like to get a specimen of
any ordered plants, a horseshoe mark from a chestnut
tree, a briar rose or something of the kind, whichever the
Captain may order, such as will tax their knowledge of
plants and will test their memory as to where they noticed
one of the kind required, and will also make them quick
in getting there and back.</p>

<p><i>Leaf Trail.</i>—It is supposed that a crime has been done,
and in the search for the culprits who have hidden themselves,
the police were helped in tracing the track by
articles left behind them. The fugitives leave behind a
dozen of certain leaves, such as oak, or chestnut or fir,
laid in the order in which those trees come on the track.
The trackers take note of these during the fifteen minutes
start. The trackers must then follow wherever these
trees are to be found, in the right order, until they can
find the fugitives. Should they not be successful another
day may be spent over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">House Hunting</h4>

<p>It is an interesting thing to take as the object of a walk
the selection of a house where you would like to live.
Notice the position, estimate the cost of rent, rates, taxes,
etc., notice its garden and how you would utilise it, and,
inside, what kind of wall-paper, etc., you would select
so it would be homely and not merely for show, in good
taste and not tawdry, airy and not stuffy with too many
hangings, which will clean, and so on. Proximity to the
necessary supply shops, doctor, telephone, post office, and
so on should all be taken into consideration, and it is
rather amusing to compare notes with the rest of your
Patrol at the end of your expedition, and see how many
got on the same house.</p>


<h4 class="center">Hints to Instructors</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Practices in Observation.</span>—<i>Instructor can take the
finger-marks of each girl. Lightly rub the thumb on
blacklead or on paper that is blackened with pencil, then
press the thumb on paper and examine with magnifying
glass. Show that no two people’s prints are alike.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Towns.</span>—<i>Practice your girls first in walking down
a street to notice the different kinds of shops as they
pass, and to remember them in their proper sequence at
the end.</i></p>

<p><i>Then to notice and remember the names of the shops.</i></p>

<p><i>Then to notice and remember the contents of a shop
window after two minutes’ gaze. Finally, to notice the
contents of several shop windows in succession with half a
minute at each. Give marks for the fullest list.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Scouts must also notice prominent buildings as
landmarks, and the number of turnings off the street they
are using.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Country.</span>—<i>Take the patrol out for a walk and
teach the girls to notice distant prominent features such
as hills, church steeples, and so on; and as nearer landmarks
such things as peculiar buildings, trees, rocks, gates,
by-roads or paths, nature of fences, crops, different kinds
of trees, birds, animals, tracks, people, vehicles, etc. Also
any peculiar smells of plants, animals, manure, etc.;
whether gates or doors were open or shut, whether any
smoke from chimney, etc.</i></p>

<p><i>Send Scouts out in pairs.</i></p>

<p><i>It adds to the value of the practice if the instructor
makes a certain number of small marks in the ground beforehand,
or leaves buttons or matches, etc., for the girls
to notice or to pick up and bring in (as a means of making
them examine the ground close to them as well as distant

<h3>CAMPCRAFT</h3>

<p><i>How to make a Fire.</i>—You should learn how to lay and
light a fire out of doors.</p>

<p>Remember the usual fault of a “tender-pad” or beginner,
is to try to make too big a fire. You will never see a
backwoodsman do that—he uses the smallest possible
amount of wood for his fire.</p>

<p>First collect your firewood. Green, fresh-cut wood is
no good, nor is dead wood that has lain long on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
ground. Get permission to break off dead branches for
it.</p>

<p>To make your fire you put a few sticks flat on the
ground, especially if the ground be damp. On this flooring
lay your “punk”—that is, paper, shavings, inner
skin of the bark of the tree, splinters, or any other material
that will easily catch fire from your match.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 364px;">
<img src="images/i_135a.jpg" width="364" height="143" alt="diagram of fire" />
</div>

<p>On this you pile, in pyramid fashion, thin twigs, splinters,
and slithers of dry wood, leaning on the “punk” and
against each other. These are called kindling. A few
stouter sticks are added over them to make the fire.</p>

<p>A good kind of kindling can easily be made by slitting a
stick into several slices or shavings, as shown. This is
called a firestick.</p>

<p>If stood up, with the shavings downwards towards the
ground, it quickly catches light and flares up.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">
<img src="images/i_135b.jpg" width="378" height="170" alt="Log fire" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Set light to this, putting your match under the bottom
of the “punk.” When the wood has really got on fire,
add more and larger sticks, and finally logs, which should
be placed star-shape, like spokes of a wheel.</p>

<p>For a cooking fire you want to make lots of red-hot
embers, so use sticks about half or three-quarters of an
inch thick.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 241px;">
<img src="images/i_136.jpg" width="241" height="69" alt="Fire stick" />
</div>

<p>For a signalling fire to make a flare at night use dry
gorse, straw, or dry twigs in large quantities.</p>

<p>For a smoke signalling fire use plenty of thin dry sticks
and twigs to give burning flame, and add leaves and grass
to make the smoke.</p>


<h4 class="center">Camping</h4>

<p>One of the ripping things about Girl Scout work is the
camp life. You go out either to live in farm buildings, or
in an empty house, or in tents.</p>

<p>People talk of “roughing it” in tents, but those people
are generally Tenderfoots. A wise Scout does not
“rough it”; she knows how to look after herself and how
to make herself comfortable by a hundred little dodges.</p>

<p>For instance, if the tents have not turned up she doesn’t
sit down to shiver and grumble, but at once sets to work
to rig up a shelter or hut for herself. She chooses a good
spot for it where she is not likely to be flooded out if a
rainstorm comes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she lights up a camp fire, cooks her food, and
makes herself comfortable on her mattress of ferns or
straw.</p>

<p>But to do this she must, of course, have first learnt how
to light a fire, how to prepare and cook her food, and
how to weave a camp mattress, and so on, all of which
she learns in her ordinary training as a Girl Scout.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/i_137.jpg" width="260" height="199" alt="scout knelt next to campfire cooking" />
<div class="caption">Camp cooking.</div>
</div>

<p>In camp you learn to make all the different things you
want, because there is not always a shop round the corner
where you can go and buy them.</p>

<p>The following are a few out of the many things that
Scouts learn to do for themselves.</p>

<p><i>In the Tent.</i>—Scouts are always tidy, whether in camp
or not, as a matter of habit. If you are not tidy at home,
you won’t be tidy in camp; and if you’re not tidy in camp,
you will never be a thorough Scout.</p>

<p>A Scout is tidy alike in her tent, bunk, or room, because
she may be suddenly called upon to go off on an
alarm, or something unexpected; and if she does not know
exactly where to lay her hand on her things, she will be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
long time in turning out, especially if called up in the
middle of the night. So on going to bed, even when at
home, practise the habit of folding up your clothes and
putting them where you can at once find them in the dark,
and get into them quickly.</p>

<p><i>Cleaning Camp Ground.</i>—Never forget also that the
state of an old camp ground after the camp has finished,
tells exactly whether the patrol or troop which has used it
was a smart one or not. No Scouts who are any good
ever leave a camp ground dirty; they sweep up and bury
or burn every scrap of rubbish.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;">
<img src="images/i_138.jpg" width="363" height="339" alt="bird on ground" />
<div class="caption">Woodpecker cleaning up debris</div>
</div>

<p>It is important to get into this habit of cleaning up your
camp ground before leaving it, as then farmers don’t have
the trouble of having to clean their ground after you leave,
and they are, therefore, all the more willing to let you
use it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Woodpecker.</i>—When you find that the ground
round a tree is strewn with tiny chips of wood you may
know at a glance that a woodpecker is making her nest
there. The woodpecker chips away the bark and makes a
deep hollow in the trunk. But she has sense enough to
know that the chips which fall are telltales, so you may
see her making efforts to tidy up the place, and in the end
she will go to the trouble of flying away with every little
chip and scrap in her beak to a distance, so that no enemy
can see that she has been cutting a hole in that tree.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;">
<img src="images/i_139.jpg" width="396" height="311" alt="gentleman looking at mess left by campers" />
<div class="caption">“No more of their camping on my ground!”</div>
</div>

<p><i>Bathing.</i>—When in camp, bathing will be one of your
joys and one of your duties, a joy because it is such fun,
a duty because no Scout can consider herself a full-blown
Scout until she is able to swim and to save life in the
water.</p>

<p>But there are dangers about bathing for which every
sensible Scout will be prepared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>First, there is the danger of cramp. This comes very
often from staying in the water too long. Ten minutes
is ample time as a rule for a girl to be in the water, five
minutes is safer.</p>

<p>If you bathe within an hour and a half of taking a meal,
that is before your food is digested, you are very likely to
get cramp. Cramp doubles you up in extreme pain so
that you cannot move your arms or legs, and down you
go and drown.</p>

<p>When bathing is going on there should always be one
or two good swimmers on duty as “life savers.” They
should not bathe themselves till the others are out of the
water, but should be in bathing-dress, ready to jump in at
any moment to help any one that they see in difficulties.</p>

<p>This plan is always strictly carried out by Boy Scouts
and Girl Scouts in camp, and has already been the means
of saving many lives and from changing a joy-camp into
a camp of mourning.</p>

<p><i>Water Supply.</i>—A Tenderfoot drinks any kind of
water that she finds handy, and consequently gets ill after
the first day camping out, and has to go home again.</p>

<p>The old campaigner is very careful indeed about getting
clean drinking water, and if she is not certain that
it is wholesome she will take care to boil it well before
drinking it, as this kills all the little germs of disease
which exist more or less in all water, however clear it may
be.</p>

<p><i>Cleanliness.</i>—Take special care to keep your kitchen
clean, and it will make you more comfortable and more
healthy in camp. More comfortable because flies will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
infest the place unless they find dirt and scraps to feed
upon.</p>

<p>More healthy because if there are flies they always
bring poison on to your food. So keep the camp kitchen
and ground round it very clean at all times. Dig a small
pit a couple of feet deep near the kitchen and throw all
refuse that won’t burn into this, and fill in the pit with
earth every night.</p>

<p>Tidy up as neatly as the woodpecker does.</p>

<p><i>Drains.</i>—Also do not neglect to dig a long trench to
serve as a latrine. Every camp, even if only for one
night, should have a sewer trench two or three feet deep,
quite narrow, not more than one foot wide, with screens
of canvas or branches on all sides.</p>

<p>Earth should always be thrown in after use, and the
trench must be filled up before leaving the place. Even
away from camp a small pit should always be dug and
filled in with earth after use. It is a cleanly habit for the
sake of other people, and also makes the camp healthier.</p>

<p>Neglect of this not only makes a place unhealthy, but it
also makes farmers and landowners disinclined to give the
use of their ground for Scouts to camp on or to work
over. So don’t forget it.</p>

<p><i>Tidiness.</i>—Tidiness in camp means tidiness in the home
and also tidiness in the streets or parks or when out picnicing.
Scouts have got a splendid name for cleaning up
their camp ground when they leave, although it is not
a pleasant duty. They do it because a dirty littered bit
of ground is not pleasant for other people to look on or
use. Therefore out in the streets or parks or country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
don’t throw away the bit of paper that held your candy
or cake. It not only makes the place look untidy, but
it means work for someone else to clear it up. Therefore,
carry your paper to the waste-paper bin, or burn
or bury it.</p>

<p><i>How to make a Bed.</i>—To manufacture a bed in camp
is a different thing from “making your bed” in a house.
To make a bed for camp use the following is the dodge:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
<img src="images/i_142.jpg" width="460" height="290" alt="a giant wood loom" />
<div class="caption">Using a camp loom.</div>
</div>

<p><i>To make a Camp Loom.</i>—Plant a row (1) of five
stakes, 2 ft. 6 in. long, firmly in the ground; opposite
to them at a distance of 6 ft. to 7 ft., drive in a row of
two and a crossbar (2). Fasten a cord or gardener’s
twine to the head of each stake in No. 1 row and stretch
it to the crossbar in No. 2 and make it fast there, then
carry the continuation of it back over No. 1 row for
some 5 ft. extra, and fasten it to a loose crossbar or
“beam” at exactly the same distance apart from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
next cord as it stands at the stakes. This beam is then
moved up and down at slow intervals by one Scout,
while the others lay bundles of fern, straw, or heather,
etc., alternately under and over the stretched strings,
which are thus bound in by the rising or falling on to
them.</p>

<p><i>Bleeding.</i>—When a man is bleeding badly from a
wound, press the wound or the flesh just above it—that
is between the wound and the heart—press it hard with
your thumb to try and stop the blood running in the
artery. Then make a pad with something like a flat
rounded pebble, and bind it over the wound. If bleeding
violently, tie a handkerchief loosely round the limb above
the wound, and twist it tight with a stick. [<i>Demonstrate
this.</i>] Keep the wounded part raised above the rest
of the body if possible. Apply cold water, or ice, if
possible, wet rags, etc.</p>

<p>Bleeding from the ears and insensibility after a fall
mean injury to the skull. The patient should not be
moved at all if possible. It is best even to keep him lying
on the spot, and put cold water or ice to his head and keep
him quiet till a doctor comes.</p>

<p>Spitting or throwing up blood means internal injury or
bursting of a small blood-vessel inside the patient. The
case often looks more serious than it really is. If the
blood is light red in colour and mixed with froth it means
injury to the lungs. In either case keep the patient
quiet and give ice to suck or cold water to sip.</p>

<p>Don’t be alarmed at the amount of blood that flows from
a patient. It used to be a common thing for the barber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to bleed a man to the extent of five or six cupfuls of
blood, and the patient feels all the better for it.</p>

<h3>HOW TO BE HEALTHY—AND WISE</h3>

<p>In addition to the exercises for your body which are
given earlier in this book you should understand what
they do for you and why you are advised to practise
them. It is not for <small>MY</small> amusement! It is for your
own health and happiness. And here are a few more
tips that will help you to be healthy, and possible wealthy,
and certainly wise—if you carry them out.</p>


<h4 class="center">Exercises and Their Object</h4>

<p>To make yourself strong and healthy it is necessary
to begin with your inside and to get the blood into good
order and the heart to work well; that is the secret of
the whole thing, physical exercises should be taken with
that intention. This is the way to do it:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Make the heart strong</i> in order to pump the
blood properly to every part of the body, and so to
build up flesh, bone, and muscle. <i>Exercise:</i> “Swimming”
and “Wrist Pushing.”</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Make the lungs strong</i> in order to provide the
blood with fresh air. <i>Exercise:</i> “Deep breathing.”</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Make the skin perspire</i> to get rid of the dirt from
the blood. <i>Exercise:</i> Bath, or rub with a damp towel
every day.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Make the stomach work</i> to feed the blood. <i>Exercise:</i>
“Body bending.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Make the bowels active</i> to remove the remains of
food and dirt from the body. <i>Exercise:</i> “Body bending”
and “Kneading the abdomen.” Drink plenty of
good water. Punctual daily move of bowels.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>Work muscles in each part of the body</i> to make
the blood circulate to that part, and so increase your
strength. <i>Exercise:</i> Walking and special exercises of
special muscles.</p>

<p>The blood thrives on simple good food, plenty of exercise,
plenty of fresh air, cleanliness of the body both
<i>inside</i> and out, and proper rest of body and mind at
intervals.</p>

<p>The Japs are particularly strong and healthy. They
eat very plain food, chiefly rice and fruit, and not much
of it. They drink plenty of water, but no spirits. They
take lots of exercise. They make themselves good-tempered.
They live in fresh air as much as possible
day and night. Their particular exercise is “<i>Ju-Jitsu</i>,”
which is more of a game than drill, and is generally
played in pairs. By Ju-Jitsu, the muscles and body are
developed in a natural way, in the open air as a rule.
It requires no apparatus.</p>


<h4 class="center">The Nose</h4>

<p>Always breathe through the nose. <i>Shut your Mouth
and Save your Life.</i> Indians for a long time adopted
that method with their children to the extent of tying
up their jaws at night, to ensure their breathing only
through their nose.</p>

<p>Breathing through the nose prevents germs of disease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
getting from the air into the throat and stomach; it also
prevents a growth in the back of the throat called
“adenoids,” which are apt to stop the breathing power
of the nostrils, and also to cause deafness.</p>

<p>For a Scout nose-breathing is also specially useful.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 270px;">
<img src="images/i_146.jpg" width="270" height="419" alt="pappoose hung on a branch" />
<div class="caption">Indian cradle: the mouth bandage to induce nose breathing</div>
</div>

<p>By keeping the mouth shut you prevent yourself from
getting thirsty when you are doing hard work. And also
at night, if you are in the habit of breathing through the
nose, it prevents snoring. Therefore practise keeping
your mouth shut and breathing through your nose.</p>


<h4 class="center">Ears</h4>

<p>A Scout must be able to hear well. Generally the
ears are very delicate, and once damaged are apt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
become incurably deaf. People are too apt to fiddle
about with their ears in cleaning them by using things
which are dangerous with such a sensitive organ as the
ear, the drum of the ear being a very delicate, tightly-stretched
skin which is easily damaged. Very many
children have had the drums of their ears permanently
injured by getting a box on the ear, or cleaning them
out roughly with the hard corner of a towel.</p>


<h4 class="center">Eyes</h4>

<p>A Scout, of course, must have particularly good eye-sight;
she must be able to see anything very quickly,
and to see at a long way off. By practising your eyes
in looking at things at a great distance they will grow
stronger. While you are young you should save your
eyes as much as possible, or they will not be strong
when you get older; therefore avoid reading by lamp-light
or in the dusk, and also sit with your back or side
to the light when doing any work during the day; if you
sit facing the light it strains your eyes.</p>

<p>The strain of the eyes is a very common failure with
growing girls, although very often they do not know it,
and headaches come most frequently from the eyes being
strained; frowning on the part of a girl is very generally
a sign that her eyes are being strained. Reading
in bed brings headaches.</p>


<h4 class="center">Teeth</h4>

<p>Bad teeth are troublesome, and are often the cause of
neuralgia, indigestion, abscesses, and sleepless nights.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
During the Boer war over three thousand of our soldiers
had to be sent away, unfit to fight, because their teeth were
so bad that they could not eat the food out there. Good
teeth depend greatly on how you look after them when
you are young. Attention to the first set of teeth keeps
the mouth healthy for the second teeth, which begin to
come when a child is seven, and these are meant to last you
to the end of your life if you keep them in order.</p>

<p>If one tooth is allowed to decay, it will spread decay
in all the others, and this arises from scraps of feed remaining
between the teeth and decaying there.</p>

<p>A thorough Scout always brushes her teeth inside and
outside and between all, just the last thing at night as
well as other times, so that no food remains about them
to rot. Scouts in camps or in the wilds of the jungle
cannot always buy tooth-brushes, but should a tiger or a
crocodile have borrowed yours, you can make your teeth
just as bright and white as his are by means of a frayed-out,
dry, clean, stick.</p>



<h3>CEREMONY FOR INVESTING SECOND
CLASS GIRL SCOUTS</h3>

<p>The troop forms in horseshoe formation, as in the case
of Tenderfoot ceremony, the Captain and Lieutenant
standing facing the troop.</p>

<p>Captain: “The Scouts (calling the list of names) have
satisfactorily passed all the tests required for a Second
Class badge, and are duly qualified to receive that badge.”</p>

<p>The Captain then calls forward, one by one, the girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
who are to receive the badge. If there is more than
one in a patrol, call all those in the same patrol together
with their patrol leader, but go through the form with
each individual girl.</p>

<p>Captain: “——————————— (name of girl), do
you now pledge yourself to renew your Scout promise,
and to fulfill the Scout Law?”</p>

<p>Scout: “On my honor, I now pledge myself to renew
the Scout promise and to fulfill the Scout law.”</p>

<p>Captain: “Invest.”</p>

<p>The Scout comes forward and stands at salute while
the Captain pins on her sleeve (where it is afterwards to
be sewed) the Second Class badge.</p>

<p>Then the Scout salutes and is saluted by the rest of
the troop, and returns to her place.</p>


<h4 class="center">Measurement of the Girl</h4>

<p><i>It is of paramount importance to teach the young citizen
to assume responsibility for her own development and
health.</i></p>

<p><i>Physical drill is all very well as a disciplinary means of
development, but it does not give the girl any responsibility
in the matter.</i></p>

<p><i>It is therefore deemed preferable to tell each girl, according
to her age, what ought to be her height, weight,
and various measurements (such as chest, waist, arm, leg,
etc.). She is then measured and learns in which points
she fails to come up to the standard. She can then be
shown which exercises to practise for herself in order to
develop those particular points. Encouragement must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
afterwards be given by periodical measurements, say,
every three months or so.</i></p>

<p><i>Cards can be obtained from the “Girl Scouts” Headquarters,
which, besides giving the standard measurements
for the various ages, give columns to be filled in
periodically, showing the girl’s remeasurements and progress
in development. If each girl has her card it is a
great incentive to her to develop herself at odd times
when she has a few minutes to spare.</i></p>


<h4 class="center">Games to Develop Strength</h4>

<p>Skipping, rowing, fencing, swimming, tennis, and hand-ball
are all valuable aids to developing strength.</p>

<p>Remember that sitting still is one form of exercise.
How can that be? Well, if you remember how you ought
to sit and keep yourself up to it you will gradually
strengthen the muscles of your back so that in a few weeks
you will sit upright naturally without any effort or
thought.</p>

<p>You may ask why shouldn’t I sit like that if it is more
comfortable. Well, do it if you like, but remember that
a large part of your time is spent sitting, sitting at lessons,
at meals, when reading or talking, and so on. Nearly
one-third of each day you are sitting, and therefore forming
yourself into one shape or the other. The thing is
to form yourself into the right one.</p>

<p>The wrong one makes you look pretty dowdy and
sloppy when you are going about, but worse than that it
lets your lungs slack down and the muscles of the stomach
relax, so that instead of drawing the full breath of air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
into your chest for renewing your blood you are only
breathing in a little driblet almost down in your stomach.</p>

<p>So buck up: correct your position while your muscles
are still young and forming themselves; later on, when
they are “set” you won’t be able to alter them. So it
just depends on you yourself whether you are going
to be a fine upstanding healthy woman or a sloppy old
thing.</p>

</div>

<p>At any rate I <i>hope</i> she won’t, because a Scout who is
content to sit down and be a Second Class Scout is only
a third class girl.</p>

<p>It is true that when she has got her Second Class,
she can go in for Proficiency Badges and cover her arm
with them, but I would much rather see a Scout with the
one Badge of First Class on her left arm than one with
a dozen on her right.</p>

<p>After all the First Class tests are not so very hard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
They look a lot, but like many other difficulties in this
world they are not so bad as they look when you smile
at them and tackle them.</p>

<p>Here are the tests that you have to go through for becoming
First Class Scouts:—</p>

<h4 class="center">How to Draw a Map</h4>

<p>Once I paid a Boer five pounds for a map which he
drew for me with a stub of a pencil on a bit of brown
paper. He had never learnt drawing or mapping, but
he was able to jot down a map that was of great value to
me in a campaign against the Zulus.</p>

<p>Almost any savage can draw you a map in the sand
with the point of his stick: so I am sure that any Scout
could do it on paper with a pencil—especially after a
little practice.</p>

<p>You know how useful it is to be able to read a map.
Well, it is still more useful to be able to draw one for
helping other people to find their way. You would not
be a real Scout unless you could do this.</p>

<div class="caption">Contour
mapping</div>
</div>

<p>The above signs are the conventional
signs used in map-making. Contouring
is most easily explained by cutting
an apple in half and placing the halves
face downwards, to represent a hill.
You can then slice the pieces horizontally
at regular distances to illustrate
heights, as shown on a map.</p>


<h4 class="center">Judging Heights and Distances</h4>

<p>Every Scout must be able to judge distance from an
inch up to a mile and more. You ought, first of all, to
know exactly what is the span of your hand and the
breadth of your thumb, and the length from your elbow
to your wrist, and the length from one hand to the
other with your arms stretched out to either side, and
also the length of your feet and of your stride; if you
remember these accurately, they are a great help to you
in measuring things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Judging the distance of objects from you is only gained
by practice, and judging the distance of a journey is generally
estimated by seeing how long you have been travelling,
and at what rate; that is to say, supposing you walk
at the rate of four miles an hour, if you have been
walking for an hour and a half you know that you have
done about six miles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">
<img src="images/i_158.jpg" width="410" height="562" alt="scout looking up at church steeple" />
<div class="caption">A Scout must be able to estimate heights.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 264px;">
<img src="images/i_159a.jpg" width="264" height="213" alt="river" />
</div>

<p>Distance can also be judged by sound; that is to say, if
you see a gun fired in the distance, and you count the
number of seconds between the flash and the sound of the
explosion reaching you, you
will be able to tell how far off
you are from the gun.</p>

<p>Sound travels at the rate of
365 yards in a second; that is,
as many yards as there are
days in the year.</p>

<p>A Scout must also be able
to estimate heights, from a few inches up to three thousand
feet or more.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 359px;">
<img src="images/i_159b.jpg" width="359" height="246" alt="diagram on estmating height" />
</div>

<p>The way to estimate the distance across a river is to
take an object <small>X</small>, such as a tree or rock on the opposite
bank; start off at right angles to it from <small>A</small>, and pace, say,
ninety yards along your bank; on arriving at sixty yards,
plant a stick or
stone, <small>B</small>; on arriving
at <small>C</small>, thirty yards beyond
that, that is
ninety from the
start, turn at right
angles and walk inland,
counting your
paces until you
bring the stick and
the distant tree in line; the number of paces that you have
taken from the bank <small>C D</small> will then give you the half distance
across <small>A X</small>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>To find the height of an object such as a tree (<small>A X</small>),
or a house, pace a distance of, say, eight yards away
from it, and there at <small>B</small> plant a stick, say, six feet high;
then pass on until you arrive at a point where the top of
the stick comes in line <small>C</small> with the top of the tree; then the
whole distance <small>A C</small> from the foot is to <small>A X</small>, the height of
the tree, the same as the distance <small>B C</small>, from the stick, is to
the height of the stick; that is, if the whole distance <small>A C</small>
is thirty-three feet, and the distance <small>B C</small> from the stick
is nine (the stick being six feet high), the tree is twenty-two
feet high.</p>

<div class="center">S.T.</div>


<h4 class="center">Games in Pathfinding</h4>

<p>Learn how to recognize the Great Bear and the Pole
Star and Orion; to judge time by the sun; find the south
by the watch. Practise map reading and finding the way
by the map; and mark off roads by blazing, broken
branches, and signs drawn on the ground.</p>

<p>Captain takes a patrol in patrolling formation into a
strange town or into an intricate piece of strange country,
with a cycling map. She then gives instructions as to
where she wants to go to, makes each Scout in turn lead
the patrol, say, for seven minutes if cycling, fifteen minutes
if walking. This Scout is to find the way entirely
by the map, and points are given for ability in reading.</p>


<h4 class="center">How to Bank Your Money</h4>

<p>To be a first-class Scout you have to have at least a
shilling (or a dollar or a rupee) in the Savings Bank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
To do this you apply at your post office to start a deposit.
The postmaster will take your money and keep it for you,
and whenever you can get a few more pennies or dimes
go and hand them in to be added to your account. As
these sums mount up you will begin to be paid back a little
“interest” by the postmaster. This you can spend on
candy—if you are foolish; but being a Scout you will
add it to the money already in the bank and so increase
your pile.</p>


<h4 class="center">How to Train a Tenderfoot</h4>

<p>You know the things that you had to do as a Tenderfoot.
It is now your business to do a good turn to
another girl by showing her how to become a Scout.
Mind you, it is all done by kindness and example. Perhaps
you will find your pupil very shy or slow or stupid.
Well, Be Prepared, for that and—smile. Be jolly with
her. Don’t try and teach her everything all at once.
Show her generally all that she has to do and then begin
with one thing and do it for her—then repeat it with her—and
finally let her do it for herself. Let her make her
mistakes at first and show her <i>afterwards</i> where she went
wrong. She will soon get the hang of it all.</p>

<p>Then your own example is what will influence her a
lot. If you get impatient and short-tempered so will she.
If you laugh and enjoy the lesson so will she, and between
you, you will get along like a house on fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>


<h3>COOKING</h3>

<p>Cooking is great fun—sometimes quite exciting, when
you try inventing new dishes.</p>

<p>You can only become a cook by practice under the help
of an experienced cook. But here are a few practical
hints that will be helpful.</p>

<p><i>Eggs.</i>—Is an egg lighter or heavier when cooked? An
experienced cook is experienced in eggs. There are
“new laid” eggs which are fresh and “fresh” eggs which
are not; there are “cooking” eggs which are liable to
squeak. Eggs are safe in their shells, and think you
don’t know whether they are fresh or not, or whether
they are raw. Any egg can be thrown out of a first-floor
window on to the lawn without the shell breaking,
it falls like a cat, right end upwards, and this is not a
boiled egg, either! You can tell that because it will not
spin on the table, so it must have been a raw egg. A
cooked egg would spin.</p>

<p>To tell a stale egg, you will see it is more transparent
at the <i>thick</i> end when you hold it up to the light.</p>

<p>Fresh eggs are more transparent in the <i>middle</i>. Very
bad eggs will <i>float</i> in a pan of water.</p>

<p><i>Poached Eggs.</i>—Break each egg separately into a cup.
When your water is boiling fast, drop in an egg sharply.
Use a large deep pan, with salt and vinegar in the water.
Lift the egg very carefully in a ladle before it is set too
hard. Place the eggs all round a soup plate, pour over
them a nice sauce, made with flour and butter, a little
milk, and some grated cheese and salt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Meat.</i>—Examine the meat before you accept it. If you
do not know the looks of good meat, you should go to a
butcher’s shop and ask him to show you how to know it.
Much gristle is a sign of old age. You can easily tell
if meat smells disagreeable. Beef should be of a bright
red color, and juicy and elastic. The fat should be firm
and of a pale straw color. Mutton should feel dryish and
the fat look white. All papers must be taken off at once.
The feet of fowls should be soft and flexible, not dry, and
the skin of the back should not be discolored.</p>

<p>Beef and mutton, when underdone, are more easily
digested than when cooked through.</p>

<p>Roasting and grilling of meat is done to so heat the
outside that the juices are kept in. The meat has to be
frequently turned to prevent it burning, but allow plenty
of salt to melt into the meat with the dripping, or it
will taste just as good as a sole of a boot.</p>

<p>As Mr. Holding said: “The only method I know of
for properly making your meat thoroughly indigestible”
is to hurry a stew.</p>

<p>To stew or braise any meat or fowl you must leave it
long and keep it slow. The flavor is improved if the meat
be fried first. Then put in flavoring vegetables, bacon,
herbs, and a little stock, and by the time you have done
a day’s work you will find a dish fit for a king. Even
tough meat can be made delicious in this way, so long
as it never gets near boiling and is closely covered. This
is a case of “Sow hurry, and you reap indigestion.”</p>

<p><i>Fish.</i>—A most unwholesome food is stale fish. The
gills, if fresh, should be bright red. Canned fish is often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
poisonous. Fish is a food which you can get more good
from, considering the price, than if you bought meat,
and the most nourishing fish and the cheapest are the
herring mackerel. Pieces of fish, buttered, can be deliciously
steamed or baked if laid between two plates over
a saucepan of water.</p>

<p><i>Oatmeal.</i>—Oats, too, are full of value; a pound and a
half a day will keep a hard-working man, for oatmeal
increases the power of the muscles, and is rich in bone
and flesh-forming materials. What you can get out of
oats for 5 cents would cost you 75 cents in lean beef.
Oats give increased mental vigour and vitality, as
they have so much nerve and brain nourishment in
them.</p>

<p>Oatmeal should be kept <i>fresh</i> in a shut case or package.</p>

<p>If you think your brain requires a fillip, eat plenty of
beans, but they must be very much cooked, and should be
well buttered.</p>

<p><i>Vegetables.</i>—Of vegetables I should like to say they
can scarcely be too much cooked. Wash well in salted
water; let leafy ones have a swim to get rid of grasshoppers
and caterpillars and sand, then put them into
boiling salted water and take off the lid. Roots may be
allowed covers.</p>

<p>Peel and slice your onions under water or at a tap.</p>

<p>I once watched a grand <i>chef</i> cooking potatoes, and he
told me that the best of the potato lies next the skin, so he
never cuts it, but he peels his potatoes on a fork after
boiling. The cunning cook boils a bunch of mint with the
potatoes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Excellent food for workers are parsnips, beetroots, or
onions.</p>

<p><i>Boiling Meat.</i>—If you want the meat and not the juice,
you should have your pot boiling fast when the meat is
put in. But if you want gravy or beef-tea (not meat),
put your meat into cold water and bring it slowly to the
boil.</p>

<p><i>Stock Pot.</i>—Keep a pot going all day, into which you
can put any broken-up bones or scraps left over, to make
nourishing broth. Clean turnips, carrots, and onions improve
it. Before using let it get cold, so as to skim off
the fat.</p>

<p>Barley, rice, or tapioca may be added, and for flavoring
add salt, pepper, chopped parsley, celery, a clove, or mace.</p>

<p><i>Milk.</i>—Milk will take the flavor of any strong smell
near it. Stale milk added to fresh will turn the whole
of it sour. Sour milk need not be wasted. You can use
it for baking or cooking, by adding bicarbonate of soda.
Sour milk will clean ink or fruit stains, and in washing
it bleaches linen. Yellowed linen should soak in it, so
should spoons and forks. Sour milk cleanses oil-cloth as
well as women’s faces and hands.
Chickens and turkeys get fat and lay
better for being fed on it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 197px;">
<img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="197" height="184" alt="block on string hanging from finger" />
</div>

<p>To <i>weigh</i> roughly, tie a loop of
string to your package of tea, sugar,
etc., and pass it on to your first finger.
I find three pounds is as much
as I can hold on my nail. If the loop is shifted to the
root of the nail, four pounds is all one can hold. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
string is placed on the first joint, I find the parcel weighs
seven pounds. Each person will be different, but you can
find out your own power of lifting, and then you will
know exactly for the future.</p>



<h3>FIRELESS COOKER</h3>

<p>A jolly useful thing for saving coal, saving time, and
saving money is a Fireless Cooker.</p>

<p>The Fireless Cooker is a very valuable help to you in
your enjoyment of camp, because once you have started
the food cooking you shove it in the Fireless Cooker, you
press the lid, and the Fireless Cooker does the rest!</p>

<p>And you can leave the dinner to cook itself while you
go out and play camp games.</p>

<p>And so, too, in your own home, once you have started
the food cooking you can put out the fire, and thus save
fuel or gas, and let the Fireless Cooker finish the job for
you.</p>


<h4 class="center">Construction of Box</h4>

<p>Obtain a large wooden box, such as a soap box. Line
with double newspaper. Fill the box to within two or
three inches of the top with very tightly packed hay, scoop
out of the centre of the hay a cavity large enough to hold
the cooking utensil. Make a cushion of house flannel to
fit the top of the box exactly and stuff it tightly with hay.</p>


<h4 class="center">Rules for Use of Fireless Cooker</h4>

<p>Use saucepans with tightly fitting lids and short handles.
Those made of aluminum or earthenware are preferable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Jam jars or large tins tightly covered may be
used.</p>

<p>Bring the food to boiling point on the gas cooker or
kitchen range and while boiling place it <i>at once</i> in the box.
Some foods require a certain amount of cooking previous
to being placed in the Fireless Cooker. (See table below.)</p>

<p>Wrap the cooking utensil in newspaper, and place in the
prepared nest in the Fireless Cooker.</p>

<p>Over this place the hay cushion and close the lid firmly.
There must be no space between the cushion and the lid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—To obtain satisfactory results, pack the stew-pan
as quickly and firmly as possible; this is to prevent
loss of heat.</p>


<h4 class="center">Average Time for Various Foods</h4>

<p><i>Meat.</i>—Cook for about half the usual time on the gas
or kitchen range, and about four to six hours in the Fireless
Cooker.</p>

<p><i>Dried Beans.</i>—Soak overnight. Boil for 30 minutes.
Allow three to four hours in the cooker.</p>

<p><i>Fresh Fruit.</i>—Bring to boiling point and place in the
cooker at once. Allow one or two hours, according to the
firmness of the fruit.</p>

<p><i>Dried Fruit.</i>—Soak overnight, bring to boiling point
and put in the cooker for three to five hours.</p>

<p><i>Oatmeal.</i>—Boil for five minutes and leave in the cooker
all night.</p>

<p><i>Quaker Oats.</i>—Bring to boiling point and leave in
the cooker two hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Other foods, such as vegetables, bacon, etc., can be
cooked by this method.</p>


<h4 class="center">Small Economics</h4>

<p>In the preparation and cooking of food there should
be very little for the garbage can, and only cabbage or egg
water for the drain.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="ingredients">
<tr><td align="left">Rinds and bones of bacon.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Outside stalks of celery.</td><td align="left" class="btrb" rowspan="4">&nbsp;</td><td align="left" rowspan="4">—Flavor soup or stock.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">The young green parts of vegetables.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Pieces of gristle, skin and bone.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Pea pods.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>Thick stems of cabbage or cauliflower leaves may be
served with the vegetables or separately, if given sufficient
time to cook.</p>

<p>Water from boiled cauliflower makes a good soup.</p>

<p>Apple skins—stones from jam—the surplus water
from bottled fruit—boiled with a little sugar and water
make a very good fruit syrup to serve with milk or suet
puddings.</p>

<p>The sugar from candied peel will sweeten and flavor a
rice pudding.</p>

<p>Water from boiled rice makes a thin stock for soups,
or can be used to stiffen articles of clothing in place of
starch.</p>

<p>The grease-proof paper from margarine, etc., will cover
steamed puddings.</p>

<p>Salt removes stains from enamel.</p>

<p>Tissue paper cut into rounds and dipped in warm milk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
will make air-tight covers for jam-pots, or can be used for
polishing glass or metal.</p>

<p>Newspapers can be used for lining the fireless cooker,
wiping greasy saucepans or knives before washing, making
fire lighters, rubbing over the stoves—the dirty pieces
can be soaked in water, made into balls and put on the
fire to keep it at a steady heat.</p>

<p>Dried orange skins, nutshells, used matches, matchboxes,
empty reels, fruit stones, are useful for fire lighting.</p>

<p>Vegetable parings not fit for food should be dried and
used as fuel unless animals are kept.</p>


<h4 class="center">Gas Stove</h4>

<p>The stove and utensils should be kept clean.</p>

<p>Shallow flat-bottomed vessels should be used.</p>

<p>A compartment steamer cooks three or four different
foods on one burner.</p>

<p>A pudding in a basin can be raised out of water by a
meat stand placed at the bottom of an ordinary saucepan—and
vegetables cooked in a perforated steam pan
above.</p>

<p>Where possible arrange a meal to be cooked all on the
top of the stove, or all in the oven.</p>

<p>Avoid heating the oven to cook a single dish.</p>

<p>Utilise all space when the oven is heated—food may
be partly or wholly cooked for following day.</p>

<p>In a gas oven three or four small tins are better than
one large tin which fills the shelf. By the former method
free circulation of heat is not prevented, and cooking is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
more efficient. If a large tin is used, have holes drilled
in it to allow passage of heat.</p>

<p>Fill the kettle before lighting the gas, and turn out the
gas before emptying the kettle.</p>

<p>Don’t <i>fill</i> the kettle if only a pint of water is wanted.</p>

<p><i>Tips for Cleaning.</i>—Directly your cooking pot is empty
pour cold water into it and put it on the fire to prevent
the leavings getting hard, it will then be quite easy to
clean later on.</p>

<p>Personally I like washing up, though some people <i>don’t</i>,
but the main thing is to keep the greasy things to the last.
Wash the cleaner things first in hot water with a clean
dishcloth, then add hotter water and deal with the greasy
things.</p>

<p>Dry the utensils with a dry towel, then dry further in
warm air, and finally polish with a soft cloth.</p>



<h3>NEEDLEWOMAN</h3>

<p><i>Needlework.</i>—“A stitch in time saves nine.” I cannot
agree with this favorite saying, because I feel sure it
saves so many more than nine, besides saving time and
preventing looking untidy.</p>

<p>I will tell you another thing I don’t believe in. Tailors,
who are such neat workers, will say that they never pin
their work first. If you are not a tailor, it is much better
to place your work before you begin, with plenty of pins.
You will never get straight lines or smooth corners if you
do not plan and place it all first, just as it has got to be,
and tack it there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Have you noticed that thread is very fond of tying
itself into a bow; but this can be prevented by threading
the needle before you cut the thread off the spool, making
your knot at the end you cut.</p>

<p>Rough measures may be said to be one inch across
a 25 cent piece, and a yard from nose to thumb as far as
you can reach. Needle-work is good for all of us; it
rests and calms the mind. You can think peacefully over
all the worries of Europe whilst you are stitching. Sewing
generally solves all the toughest problems, chiefly
other people’s.</p>

<p><i>The Scouts’ Patch.</i>—I don’t know whether you ever
did such a thing as burn a hole in your dress, but I have,
and if it is in the front, oh, dear! what will mother say?
Now, there is a very good way that Scouts have of making
it all right and serviceable; they put in a piece and
darn it in all round. If possible, get a piece of the same
stuff, then it will not fade a different tint, and will wear
the same as the rest. You may undo the hem and cut
out a bit, or perhaps you may have some scraps over
from cutting out your dress.</p>

<p>The piece must be cut three or four inches larger than
the hole and frayed out on all four sides. Trim the hole
with your scissors neatly all round quite square with the
thread. Then lay your piece over the hole—of course,
on the back or “wrong side”—and tack it there with
cotton. Now take a darning needle, and thread each
thread in turn and darn each one into the stuff. If the
ends of stuff are very short, it is best to run your needle
in and out where you are going to darn, and then, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
pulling it through, thread it with the wool. This patching
is excellent for table-linen.</p>

<p>I once had an aunt who was a thorough old Scout, and
was rather proud of her mending, and she always said
that she didn’t mind what colored cotton you gave her
to sew with, because her stitches hardly ever showed, they
were so small, and also she put them inside the stuff.
If she was putting on a patch to blue stuff, she could do
it with red cotton, and you would never have noticed it
on the right side; her stitches were all under the edge.
Or else she sewed it at the back, on the “wrong” side,
so that it looked perfectly neat.</p>

<p>If you are not able to match the wool for a darn, it is
a good plan to use the ravellings of the stuff itself.
Sometimes, away in the country, you can’t go to shop
and you have nothing like the piece you want to mend.
A Scout would turn it inside out and undo a little of the
hem and ravel out the edge. Suppose you were to cut a
hole in the front of your blue serge skirt; if you darn it
with the ravellings of the turnings of the seam or the hem,
that will be exactly the same color and the same thickness
as your dress. No wool you could buy would
match as well. Or if you want to mend a jersey or
knitted gloves, you never could buy such a good match—the
same sized wools and the tints.</p>



<h3>HOW TO DEAL WITH FIRES AND
ACCIDENTS</h3>

<p><i>Fire.</i>—If you discover a house on fire you should—</p>

<p>1st—Alarm the people inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>2nd—Warn the nearest policeman or fire-brigade station.</p>

<p>3rd—Rouse neighbours to bring ladders, mattresses,
carpets, to catch people jumping.</p>

<p>After arrival of fire engines the best thing girls can do
is to help the police in keeping back the crowd out of the
way of the firemen, hose, etc.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to go into a house to search for feeble
insensible people, the thing is to place a wet handkerchief
or worsted stocking over your nose and mouth and
walk in a stooping position, or crawl along on your hands
and knees quite near the floor, as it is here that there is
least smoke or gas. Also, for passing through fire and
sparks, if you can, get hold of a blanket, and wet it,
and cut a hole in the middle through which to put
your head; it forms a kind of fireproof mantle, with
which you can push through flames and sparks. [<i>Practice
this.</i>]</p>

<p>If you find a person with his clothes on fire, you should
throw him flat on the floor, because flames only burn
upwards, then roll him up in the hearthrug or carpet, coat
or blanket, and take care in doing so that you don’t catch
fire yourself. The reason for doing this is that fire cannot
continue to burn where it has no air.</p>

<p>When you find an insensible person (and very often
in their fright they will have hidden themselves under
beds and tables, etc.), you should either carry him out on
your shoulder, or, what is often more practicable in the
case of heavy smoke, gas fumes, or in battle when under
heavy fire, etc., harness yourself on to him with sheets or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
cords and drag him out of the room along the floor,
crawling on all fours yourself.</p>

<p>A soldier was recently awarded the Distinguished Conduct
Medal for thus getting his wounded officer into
safety while being fired at by the enemy.</p>

<p>To do this you lay the patient on his back, make a bowline
at each end of your rope, one you put over the
patient’s chest and under his arms, and the other over
your own neck, then with your back to his head you
start on “all fours” to pull him along, head first. If
the bowline is the right length it will keep his head up
off the ground, as the picture shows.</p>

<div class="caption">\Moving an insensible girl.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Burns.</i>—In treating a man who has been burnt, remove
his clothes, not by peeling them off, but by cutting them
with a <small>SHARP</small> knife or scissors. If any part of the dress
sticks to the skin from having been burnt there do not
tear it away, but cut the cloth round it, then as quickly
as possible protect the burnt parts from the air, which
causes intense pain. The best way to protect them is
by dusting them with powdered chalk or flour, or by laying
strips of lint well soaked in sweet oil or linseed oil,
and covering the whole with cotton wool, or by pouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
on oil. Keep the patient warm, and give warm drinks,
such as hot tea, hot milk, or salomonia and water.</p>

<p>Major John Garroway, <small>M.D.</small>, strongly recommends, instead
of flour or oil to stop the pain of a burn, to put a
piece of paper firmly over the wound, and the pain will
be relieved in a few seconds.</p>

<p>Quite a large number of Scouts have saved lives in the
water through knowing how to swim and what to do.
Several Scouts have also saved life in fire, and have
received medals for saving life.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Saving Life from Drowning.</i>—A moderate swimmer
can save a drowning man if she knows how, and has practised
it a few times with her friends. The popular idea
that a drowning person rises three times before he finally
sinks is all nonsense. He often drowns at once, unless
someone is quick to help him. The important point is
not to let the drowning person catch hold of you, or he
will probably drown you too. Keep behind him always.
If you find yourself clutched by the wrist, turn your wrist
against his thumb and force yourself free. Your best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
way in helping a drowning man is to keep behind and hold
him up by the elbows, or by the back of the neck, or by
putting your arms under his armpits and your hands
across his chest, and telling him to keep quiet and not to
struggle. If he obeys, you can easily keep him afloat;
but otherwise be careful that in his terror he does not
turn over and catch hold of you. If he should seize you
by the neck, Holbein says, “Scrag him, and scrag him
quickly. Place your arm round his waist, and the other
hand, palm upwards, under his chin, with your fingertips
under his nose. Pull and push with all your might,
and he must perforce let go.” But you will never remember
this unless you practise it frequently with other
people first, each taking it in turns to be the drowning
man or rescuer.</p>

<p>[<i>Practice this.</i>]</p>

<p>If you see a person fall into the water and begin to
drown, and you yourself are unable to swim, you must
throw a rope, or an oar, or plank right over him, so
that when he comes up again he may clutch at it and
hold it.</p>

<p><i>Drowning.</i>—To restore any one who is apparently
drowned, it is necessary at once to clear the water out of
his lungs, for which purpose, therefore, you should incline
him face downwards and head downwards, so that the
water may run out of his mouth, and to help it you
should open his mouth and pull forward his tongue.
After running the water out of the patient, place him on
his side with his body slightly hanging down, and keep the
tongue hanging out. If he is breathing, let him rest; if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
he is not breathing, you must at once endeavour to restore
breathing artificially.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 307px;">
<img src="images/i_177.jpg" width="307" height="432" alt="girl throwing ring off rock" />
<div class="caption">“If I can’t swim I have at least learnt how to fling a lifebuoy.”</div>
</div>

<p>There are several ways of reviving persons apparently
drowned. You may find one person eager to do exactly
the opposite of another, but do not fight over it; the best
thing is to do quickly whatever you can. Probably
“Schäfer’s system” is the simplest. Lay the patient
down with his bent arm to support the forehead.</p>

<p>Place your hands on the small of the patient’s back,
one on each side, with thumbs parallel and nearly touching,
and the fingers reaching only to the lowest ribs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Bend forward with the arms straight, so as to allow
the weight of your body to fall on your wrists, and then
make a firm, steady downward pressure on the loins of
the patient, while you count slowly, one—two—three,
to press the patient’s stomach against the ground and to
force the air from his chest.</p>

<p>Then swing your body backwards so as to relieve the
pressure, and without removing your hands, while you
count slowly, one—two.</p>

<p>Continue this backward and forward movement, alternately
relieving and pressing the patient’s stomach against
the ground in order to drive the air out of his chest and
mouth, and allowing it to suck itself in again, until gradually
the patient begins to do it for himself.</p>

<p>The proper pace for the movement should be about
twelve pressures to the minute.</p>

<p>As soon as the patient is breathing, you can leave off
the pressure; but watch him, and if he fails you must
start again or get some one to take your place till he
can breath for himself.</p>

<p>Then let him lie in a natural position, and set to work
to get him warm by putting hot flannels or bottles of hot
water between his thighs, and under the arms, and against
the soles of his feet, but not before he is breathing. Wet
clothing should be taken off and hot blankets rolled round
him. The patient should be disturbed as little as possible,
and encouraged to sleep, while carefully watched for at
least an hour afterwards.</p>

<p>This is called the Schäfer method, and can be used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
equally well for drowned people or for those overcome
with smoke or gas fumes.</p>

<p>Now just practise this with another Scout a few times,
so that you understand exactly how to do it, and so Be
Prepared to do it to some poor fellow, maybe, really in
need of it one day.</p>

<p>Make the Scouts, in pairs, practise above.</p>

<p>Wounded: taking off clothes. Pull off from the well
or uninjured side first, then when all is loose, carefully
uncover the injured part. Try not to move it, cut the
sleeve or trouser up the seam with the rounded end of
scissors inside the cloth. If clothes have to be put on
again, sew pairs of tapes to edges.</p>


<h4 class="center">Accidents</h4>

<p><i>Electric Shock.</i>—Men frequently get knocked insensible
by touching an electric cable or rail. The patient
should be moved from the rail, but you have to be careful
in doing this that you don’t get the electric shock also.
In the first place put glass, if possible, for yourself to
stand upon, or dry wood if glass is not obtainable, or
put on india-rubber boots. Also put on india-rubber
gloves before touching the patient. If you have none,
wrap your hands in several thicknesses of <i>dry</i> cloth, and
pull the patient away with a stick.</p>

<p>A boy was hunting butterflies at St. Ouen, in France,
the other day, when he fell on the “live” rail of the electric
railway and was instantly killed by the shock. A
passer-by, in trying to lift him off, fell dead beside him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
A brickmaker ran up and tried to rescue them, and was
himself struck dead in the same way. The two would-be
rescuers were killed through not having learned beforehand
what was the right thing to do.</p>

<div class="center">S.T.</div>

<p><i>Gas, Smoke, or Fumes.</i>—Accidents are continually
occurring from escapes of gas in mines, sewers, and
houses.</p>

<p>In endeavoring to rescue a person, keep your nose and
mouth well covered with a wet handkerchief, and get
your head as close to the floor as possible, and drag the
insensible person out as I have suggested in case of a
fire. Drag your patient as quickly as possible into the
fresh air—(I say as quickly as possible, because if you
delay about it you are very apt to be overcome by the
noxious gas yourself)—then loosen all his clothing about
the neck and chest, dash cold water in his face. If you
find that he is no longer breathing, then treat him as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
would a drowned person, and try and work back the
breath into his body.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 721px;">
<img src="images/i_180.jpg" width="721" height="254" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Push a long ladder or pole across the hole.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Ice Accidents.</i>—If a person falls through ice, and is
unable to get out again because of the edges breaking,
throw him a rope and tell him not to struggle. This may
give him confidence until you can get a long ladder or
pole <small>ACROSS</small> the hole, which will enable him to crawl out,
or will allow you to crawl out to catch hold of him.</p>


<h4 class="center">First Aid</h4>

<p>When you see an accident in the street or people injured,
the sight of the torn limbs, the blood, the broken
bones, and the sound of the groans and sobbing all make
you feel sick and horrified and anxious to get away from
it—if you’re not a Girl Scout. But that is cowardice:
your business as a Scout is to steel yourself to face it
and to help the poor victim. As a matter of fact, after
a trial or two you really get to like such jobs, because
with coolheadedness and knowledge of what to do you
feel you give the much-needed help.</p>

<div class="center">S.T.</div>

<p>Every Scout should not only <i>know how</i>, but should
from frequent practice be <i>able to do</i> the right thing in
every kind of accidental injury.</p>

<p>In an accident when you are alone with the injured
person, if he is unconscious lay him on his back with
his head a little raised and on one side so that he does
not choke, and so that any vomit or water, etc., can
run out of his mouth. Loosen the clothing about his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
neck and chest. See where he is injured, and treat him
according to what you are taught in learn “First Aid.”</p>

<p>If you have found the man lying insensible you should
carefully examine the ground round him for any “sign,”
and take note of it and of his position, etc., in case it
should be afterwards appear that he had been attacked
by others.</p>

<p>[<i>Practise above, one girl as patient, the other to find
her. Make “sign” round the patient.</i>]</p>

<p>If you are out with a patrol and an accident happens,
or you find an injured man, the patrol leader should direct
one scout to go for a doctor; she herself will attend to the
patient with one Scout to help her. The second will use
the other Scouts in assisting by getting water or blankets,
or making a stretcher, or keeping the crowd back by
forming a fence with their ropes.</p>

<p>As a rule it is best to keep the patient quite quiet at
first; unless it is necessary, do not try to move him; and
don’t bother him with questions until he recovers a bit.</p>

<p><i>Broken Limbs.</i>—How to tell when a limb is broken.</p>

<p>There is generally a swelling and pain about the place
where the bone has broken, and sometimes the limb
is bent in an unnatural way and the patient cannot use it.</p>

<p>The broken limb should not be moved about at all, but
should be straightened and bound to something stiff that
will keep it stiff and straight while the patient is being
moved to hospital or home.</p>

<p><i>Splints.</i>—The stiff thing that you tie to the injured
limb is called a splint. This may be anything such as a
wooden batten, Scout’s staff, tightly rolled newspaper, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Splints should be long enough to go beyond the joints
above and below the break. You should put a splint on
each side of the limb if possible.</p>

<p>Then bind the splints firmly from end to end with handkerchiefs
or strips of linen or cloths, but not so tightly
as to stop the blood circulating or to press into the
swelling.</p>

<p>[<i>Practise this.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Bandage.</i>—For binding a broken limb you want a good
large three-cornered bandage. Its two
sides should be each about forty inches
long.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 153px;">
<img src="images/i_183.jpg" width="153" height="236" alt="girl wth arm in sling" />
<div class="caption">Bandaging.</div>
</div>

<p>To make a sling for broken arm or collarbone,
hang the bandage round the patient’s
neck, tying the two ends together
in a reef-knot with the point of the
bandage towards the damaged arm.
Rest the arm in this sling and bring the
point round the back of the arm and pin
it to hold the elbow in the sling.</p>

<p><i>Fishhook in the Skin.</i>—I got a fishhook into my finger
the other day. I got a knife and cut off all the fly which
was on the hook, then pushed the hook farther into my
finger till the point began to push against the skin from
inside. With a sharp knife I cut a little slit in the skin
so that the point came easily through, and I was then able
to get hold of it and to pull the whole hook through.
Of course you cannot get a hook out backwards, as the
barb holds tight in the flesh all the time. Such fun!</p>

<p><i>Frost-bite.</i>—In Arctic countries or extreme cold men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
are liable to get frost-bitten. That is, their ears, or nose,
or fingers, or toes get killed by the cold. The patient does
not feel any pain; the part becomes numb and turns very
white and waxy, and afterwards purple.</p>

<p>Directly this is noticed the part should be rubbed with
snow or with the hand until the blood comes back to it.
On no account should it be warmed by putting the patient
in a warm room or near a fire; that would kill the part
at once.</p>

<p><i>Hysterics.</i>—Nervous people, especially women, get
hysterics when excited, crying, laughing, and screaming.
The best treatment is to shut the patient into a room and
leave her entirely alone till she gets over it. Don’t try
and soothe her, it only makes her worse.</p>

<p><i>Fainting.</i>—If your patient faints and is pale—fainting
comes from too little blood in the head—make him sit
down, and push his head down between his knees. Pressure
on a nerve (for instance, in top of eye socket) will
often revive. If his face is flushed raise the head—there
is too much blood in it, as in apoplexy or sunstroke.</p>

<p><i>Toothache.</i>—This is not mentioned in most first aid
instructions, and yet you can earn many blessings by
knowing how to relieve it. Here is a simple way that is
generally successful, especially if the offending tooth is
in the upper jaw. Steep a little bit of cotton-wool in
spirits of camphor. Stuff the wool into one nostril—hold
the other nostril tight shut and make the patient draw
in the air through the wool. The spirit is thus sucked in on
to the nerve, which lies near the back of the nose, and it
very quickly relieves the pain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fits.</i>—A man cries out and falls, and twitches and
jerks his limbs about, froths at the mouth: he is in a fit.
It is no good to do anything to him before the doctor
comes except to put a bit of wood or cork between his
jaws, so that he does not bite his tongue. Let him sleep
well after a fit.</p>

<p><i>Poisoning.</i>—If a person suddenly falls very ill after
taking food, or is known to have taken poison, the first
thing to do is to make him swallow some milk or raw
eggs. These seem to collect all the poison that is otherwise
spread about inside him. Then, if the mouth is not
stained or burnt by the poison, make him vomit if possible
by giving him salt and warm water, and try tickling the
inside of his throat with a feather. Then more eggs and
milk, and weak tea. If the poison is an acid that burns,
the patient should not be made to vomit, but milk or salad
oil should be given. The patient should be kept awake if
he gets drowsy.</p>

<p><i>Blood-Poisoning.</i>—This results from dirt being allowed
to get into a wound. Swelling, pain, red veins
appear. Fomenting with hot water is the best relief.</p>

<p><i>Choking.</i>—Loosen collar; hold the patient’s nose with
one hand and with the forefinger of the other, or with
the handle of a spoon try and pull out whatever is stuck
in his throat. By pressing down the root of the tongue
you may make him vomit and throw out the obstruction.
For slight choking make patient bend head well back
and swallow small pills made of bread, and sip water.
Sometimes a good hard smack on the back will do him
good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Choking sometimes comes from a sudden swelling inside
the throat. In this case put hot steaming flannel
fomentations to the neck and give the patient ice to suck
or cold water to sip.</p>

<p><i>Quinsy.</i>—When I was in the Andes Mountains in
South America recently, I heard of two Englishmen who
had died there not long before from choking by quinsy,
simply because there was no one by who knew what to
do in such a case. Everybody ought to Be Prepared to
deal with quinsy if away from the help of doctors.</p>

<p>Most people suffer from tonsillitis at one time or another
in their lives—that is a swelling of the tonsils—the
round lumps of flesh on each side of the back of
the throat. And sometimes, on rare occasions, the swelling
becomes so great that the patient cannot breathe, the
throat becomes completely blocked up. This is quinsy.</p>

<p>Very hot fomentations is the best step towards easing
the pain and reducing the swelling.</p>

<p>The extreme measure is to lance the patient’s tonsils.</p>

<p><i>Acid Burning.</i>—A case occurred only the other day of
a woman throwing vitriol over a man’s face. This is an
awful acid, which burns and eats away the flesh wherever
it touches. Fortunately a policeman happened to be on
the spot at the time, and knew what to do. He at once
applied half warm water to which some soda had been
added to wash off the acid, and then applied flour or
whitening to protect the wound from the air and ease
the pain as you would do for a burn.</p>

<p><i>Snake Bite.</i>—Fortunately poisonous snakes are uncommon.
If you go abroad you may come across them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and you ought always to know how to deal with bites
from them. The same treatment does also for wounds
from poisoned arrows, mad dogs, etc. Remember the
poison from a bite gets into your blood, and goes all
through your body in a very few beats of your pulse.
Therefore, whatever you do must be done immediately.
The great thing is to stop the poison rushing up the
veins into the body. To do this bind a cord or handkerchief
immediately round the limb <i>above</i> the place
where the patient has been bitten, so as to stop the blood
flying back to the heart with the poison. Then try and
suck the poison out of the wound, and, if possible, cut
the wound still more, to make it bleed, and run the
poison out. The poison, when sucked into the mouth,
does no harm unless you have a wound in your mouth.
The patient should also be given stimulants, such as coffee
or spirits, to a very big extent, and not allowed to become
drowsy, but should be walked about and pricked and
smacked in order to keep his senses alive.</p>

<p>[<i>Practise this process in make-believe.</i>]</p>

<div class="center">S.T.</div>

<p><i>Grit in the Eye.</i>—Do not let your patient rub the eye;
it will only cause inflammation and swelling, and so make
the difficulty of removing the grit all the greater.</p>

<p>If the grit is in the lower eyelid, draw down the lid as
far as you can, and gently brush it out with the corner
of a moistened handkerchief, or with a paint brush, or
feather.</p>

<p>If it is under the upper lid, pull the lid away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
eyeball and push the under lid up underneath the upper
one. In this way the eyelashes of the lower lid will generally
clean the inside of the upper one.</p>

<p>Another way, which every Scout must practise, is to
seat your patient and stand behind him yourself with the
back of his head against your chest. Lay a card, match,
or any flat substance under your own thumb on the upper
part of the upper eyelid, and then catch hold of the edge
of the eyelid and draw it upwards over the match so that
it turns inside out; gently remove the grit with a feather
or wet handkerchief, and roll the eyelid down again.</p>

<p>If the eye is much inflamed, bathe it with luke-warm
weak tea.</p>

<p>If the grit is firmly imbedded in the eye, drop a little
oil (olive or castor oil) into the lower lid; close the eye,
and bandage it with a soft wet pad and bandage, and get
a doctor to see it.</p>

<p>[<i>Practise above.</i>]</p>

</div>

<p>How to make eye-tweezers for removing a piece of
grit from eye. Fold a piece of paper
in two. With a sharp knife cut it to a
point of an angle of 30°, and slightly
moisten the point. Then bring it straight down over the
eyeball of the patient, so that it can nip the obstruction,
which is generally removed at the first attempt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stretchers</span> may be arranged in some of the following
ways:</p>

<p>(a) A hurdle, shutter, door, gate, covered well with
straw, hay, clothing, sacking.</p>

<p>(b) A piece of carpet, blanket, sacking, tarpaulin or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Girl Scout skirts, spread out, and two stout poles rolled
up in the sides. Put clothes for a pillow.</p>

<p>(c) Two coats, with the sleeves turned inside out; pass
two poles through the sleeves; button the coats over them.</p>

<p>(d) Two poles passed through a couple of sacks,
through holes at the bottom corners of each.</p>

<p>In carrying a patient on a stretcher be careful that he
is made quite comfortable before you start. Let both
bearers rise together; they must walk <i>out of step</i>, and
take short paces. It should be the duty of the hinder
bearer to keep a careful watch on the patient.</p>

<p>If the poles are short four bearers will be necessary, one
at each corner of the stretcher.</p>

<p>[<i>Practice these different methods.</i>]</p>


<h4 class="center">How to Practise</h4>

<p><i>In practising First Aid it is a great thing to bespatter
the patient with blood and mud to accustom the rescuer to
the sight of it, otherwise it will often unnerve him in a
real accident. Sheep’s blood can be got from the butcher’s
shop.</i></p>

<p><i>Prepare a heavy smoke fire in a neighbouring room or
building (if possible on the first floor), while you are lecturing
in the club room. Secretly arrange with two or
three Scouts that if an alarm of fire is given they should
run about frightened and try and start a panic.</i></p>

<p><i>Have the alarm given either by getting some one to
rush in and tell you of the fire, or by having some explosive
bombs fired. Then let a patrol, or two patrols,
tackle the fire under direction of their patrol leaders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
They should shut windows and doors. Send Scouts into
different parts of the building to see if the fire is spreading,
and to search for people in need of rescue.</i></p>

<p><i>These Scouts should have wet handkerchiefs over their
mouths and noses. “Insensible” people (or sack dummies)
should be hidden under tables, etc.</i></p>

<p><i>Scouts rescue them by shouldering or dragging them
out and getting them down to the ground. Use jumping
sheet, chute, etc.</i></p>

<p><i>Other parties lay and connect the hose, or make lines
for passing fire buckets.</i></p>

<p><i>Another party revive the rescued by restoring animation.
Another party form “fence” to help the police
and fire brigade by keeping the crowd back.</i></p>


<h4 class="center">Games</h4>

<p>“<i>Dragging Race.</i>”—A line of patients of one patrol
are laid out at fifty yards distance from start. Another
patrol, each carrying a rope, run out, tie ropes to the
patients, and drag them in. Time taken of last in. Patrols
change places. The one which completes in shortest
time wins. Knots must be correctly tied.</p>

<div class="center">S.T.</div>


<h4 class="center">Physical Exercises and Health Rules</h4>

<p>The simple physical exercises given in the earlier chapters
will give you all the movements needed to keep you
well and to help your growth <small>IF</small> you only practise them.
That is the secret. Set apart certain minutes in the day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
especially in the early morning, and make it your habit
to go through these exercises and you will make for yourself
a wonderful difference in your health.</p>

<p>But alongside this giving health to your body, you
must see to it that your surroundings, your home, the air,
your food, and your clothing are also health-giving, otherwise
all the exercise in the world will not help you.</p>


<h4 class="center">Health Rules for the Home</h4>

<p>Scouts should do everything in their power to make and
keep their homes healthy as well as happy.</p>

<p>Most of you cannot choose your own dwelling, but
whether you live in a house, a cottage, a flat, in rooms,
or even in one room of a house, you can do a very great
deal to keep it healthy and pure.</p>

<p>Fresh air is your great friend; it will help you to fight
disease better than anything else. Open all your windows
as often as you can, so that the air may get into every
nook and corner. Never keep an unused room shut up.
Disease germs, poisonous gases, mildew, insects, dust,
and dirt have it all their own way in stale, used-up air.
Air does not flow in and flow out of the same opening
at the same time any more than water does, so you want
two openings in a room—an open window to let the good
air in, and a fireplace and chimney to let the stale air out,
or whether there is no fireplace, a window open both at
top and bottom. The night air in large towns is purer
than the day air, and both in town and country you should
sleep with your window open if you want to be healthy.
Draughts are not good, as they carry away the heat from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
your body too fast; so if your bed is too near the window,
put up a shelter between it and the open window and
cover yourself more. At least one window on a staircase
or landing should always be kept open, and also the pantry
and the closet windows.</p>

<p><i>Tidiness.</i>—Half your time will be saved if little things
are kept tidy. Have a place for everything, and have
everything in its place. If you are not sure which is the
right place for a thing, think “<i>Where, if I wanted it,
should I go to look for it?</i>” That place is the right one.
Get into the habit of always making a ball of any string
you get and collect them.</p>

<p>War must be waged against rats and mice, or they will
invade you and loot everything. If you have no mouse-traps,
put a newspaper over a pail of water, break a hole
slightly in the centre in the form of a star, and place a
bit of cheese on the centre tips of star to entice the mouse.
Let the paper reach to the floor, not too upright, for the
mouse to climb up. Try putting broken camphor into
their holes; they dislike the smell. Fly and wasp traps
are made by tying paper over a tumbler half-filled with
water and beer or molasses. Break a hole in the paper,
and fit in a tube of rolled paper about one inch long and
one inch across.</p>

<p><i>Damp</i> is never healthy, and you can prevent it to a
great extent by letting plenty of fresh air go through
your house and rooms which have been shut up.</p>

<p>When you see signs of damp, try to find out the cause;
it may be put right. A pipe or gutter may have got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
blocked, or there may be a loose shingle, or the water
pipes may be leaking.</p>

<p>In countries where there are mosquitoes people are very
careful not to allow any water to lie near their houses, for
the poisonous mosquito breeds in stagnant water. Sunflowers
planted near a house help to keep the soil dry;
also low bushes and plants. Consumption and other
deadly disease germs flourish in damp, ill-aired houses.</p>

<p><i>Sunlight</i> is a great health-giver and disinfectant, and
the more of it you have in your house the better. Long
ago people used to shut out the sun and air for fear their
curtains and carpets would fade, but it is far better that
the sun should fade your curtains than that the darkness
should fade you. Cases of consumption are rare in dry,
sunny houses.</p>

<p>Nurseries and bedrooms should have plenty of morning
and mid-day sun.</p>

<p>Motto: “<i>Tidy as you go</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Cleanliness</i> in every part of the house is most necessary,
especially kitchen and refrigerators. Do not let
dust or rubbish collect anywhere, behind furniture or
pictures, under beds, or in cupboards. If we realised
what horrid things we may collect from pavement or
street dust on our skirts and shoes, we should be much
more careful about the dusting of our rooms.</p>

<p>Do not allow dogs, cats, or birds to be where they can
touch your food or your cooking utensils; animals have
diseases too. Flies, gnats, and fleas are most dangerous
pests; they feed on decayed and diseased things, and may
carry poison on their feet and leave it on your food.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Keep them out of your house, and especially chase them
out of your kitchen and larder. Any bad smell in a house
is a danger signal; find out its cause, and get rid of it.</p>

<div class="center">S.T.</div>

<p>Be sure your drinking water is pure. If you are at all
doubtful about it, <i>boil it well</i>—that is, for not less than
fifteen minutes. Water cisterns should be often cleaned
out. See that all drains, sinks, and closets are in good
order. A very poisonous gas called sewer gas comes
from bad drains, and typhoid, diphtheria, etc., are caused
by drinking bad water and bad drainage. The gas does
not come up if there is a “trap” full of water in the
pipe; that is a curve in the pipe where water collects.
Let water run down all sinks once or twice a day to rinse
the pipes. To sum up, “Remember that nearly all the
<i>dangers</i> to health in a house or room begin with a D, and
these dangers or destroyers are:</p>

<ul class="normal"><li>“Darkness.</li>
<li>“Damp.</li>
<li>“Dust.</li>
<li>“Dirt.</li>
<li>“Doubtful drinking water.</li>
<li>“Defective drains.”</li></ul>

<p>Against these destroyers, which bring debility, disease
and even death, the Scouts’ defences are:</p>


<ul class="normal"><li>“Sunlight.</li>
<li>“Fresh air.</li>
<li>“Cleanliness.”</li></ul>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span><i>Housewifery.</i>—Every Scout is as much a “housewife”
as she is a girl. She is sure to have to “keep
house” some day, and whatever house she finds herself in,
it is certain that that place is the better for her being
there.</p>

<p>Too many odds and ends and draperies about a room
are only dust-traps, and rugs or carpet squares, which can
be taken up easily, are better than nailed down carpets.
Keep all the furniture clean and bright. Fresh air, soap,
and water are the good housewife’s best allies. Bars of
soap should be cut up in squares and kept for six weeks
before being used. This hardens it and makes it last
longer.</p>

<p>In scrubbing boarded floors, the secret is not to deluge
the floor; change the water in the pail frequently.</p>

<p>In the work of cleaning think out your plan beforehand,
so as not to dirty what has been cleaned. Plan
out certain times for each kind of work and have your
regular days for doing each thing.</p>

<p><i>Pasteboards and Deal Tables.</i>—Scrub hard the way
of the grain. Hot water makes boards and tables yellow.
Rinse in cold water and dry well.</p>

<p><i>Saucepans.</i>—New saucepans must not be used till
they have first been filled with cold water and a little
soda, and boiled for an hour or so, and must be well
scoured. After bowls or saucepans have been used, fill
them at once with cold water to the brim; this will prevent
anything hardening on the saucepan and will make cleaning
easier.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">Swimming</h4>

<p><i>Swimming.</i>—Every 1st Class Scout ought to be able to
swim. It is not only for her own amusement that she
should do so, but so that she will not cause other people to
risk their lives in rescuing her when she gets into difficulties
in the water, and that she may be able to help those in
distress. British girls are behindhand in learning to swim—it
is very different in Norway and Sweden, or in America,
where nearly every girl can swim.</p>

<p>Where a doctor says swimming is bad for her, or there
is no possible means for her learning, such other badges
that she does not hold may be accepted instead towards
qualifying the Scout for her 1st Class.</p>

<p>No Scout can be of real use till she can swim, and to
learn swimming is no more difficult than to learn bicycling.</p>

<p>All you have to do is at first to try and swim like a dog,
as if trying to crawl slowly along in the water; don’t try
all at once to swim with the ordinary breast stroke that
swimmers use, because this only lets your mouth go under
water every time. When paddling along like a dog get a
friend to support you at first with a pole or his hand under
your belly.</p>

<p>Any of you who cannot swim as yet, and who fall into
the water out of your depth, remember that you need
not sink if you take care to do the following things.
First, keep your mouth upwards by throwing the head
well back. Secondly, keep your lungs full of air by taking
in long breaths, but breathe out very little. Thirdly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
keep your arms under water. To do this you should not
begin to shout, which will only empty your lungs, and you
should not throw your arms about or beckon for help, else
you will sink. So the main thing of all is to keep cool and
force yourself to remember and to carry out these things.</p>



<h3>CHILD WELFARE</h3>

<p>There always are and always will be children to be
care of. Perhaps there is no better way for a girl to
help her country than to fit herself to undertake the care
of children. She should learn all she can about them,
and take every opportunity of helping to look after these
small Boy and Girl Scouts of the future. Many girls
are already doing this and are realizing that the Child
Welfare badge is one of the most important in the whole
list for a Scout to win.</p>


<h4 class="center">Health Habits</h4>

<p>Children are trained to regular habits in three ways;
first, by having meals at fixed hours; second, by having
regular times for sleeping and waking; and third, by
being taught when young to be clean and regular in their
daily clear-out. They must have plenty of healthful,
peaceful sleep and the earlier they go to bed the better for
their brains and nerves in after life. The bedroom must
be airy and quiet; the windows kept open.</p>


<h4 class="center">Bath</h4>

<p>Nobody can be healthy unless he is clean, and cleanliness
is one of the first habits you want Baby to form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
So he should have a daily bath. The temperature for
his bath should range from 80° to 98° and you should
be able to read the bath thermometer as well as the room
thermometer. Before you undress Baby get together
everything that you will need for the bath and dressing;
your hand basin of warm water, soap, soft wash cloths
and towels, comb and brush, etc., and his clothes laid out
in the order in which you will put them on.</p>

<p>It is handier as well as safer to begin baby laid on a
table or bed rather than on your lap. He should of course
have under him a soft towel or canton flannel. First
wash his head carefully and rub it dry gently. Do the
outer parts of his ears and let no water get inside them.
The nose may be cleaned with a bit of cotton rolled to a
point and the nails should be carefully cleaned. Then
put him gently in the tub. Some people soap the baby
first, and a soapy little baby wiggles, so hold him very
firmly and comfortably, supporting his head all the time
he is kicking and splashing in the tub. After you lift him
out be careful to dry all the creases in his little body. It
is perfectly proper for a baby to cry as much as twenty
minutes every day till he begins to talk, and he may take
his bath time for doing it, so don’t scold him. A baby
can be kept sweet and clean by a daily sponge bath.</p>


<h4 class="center">Food</h4>

<p>The baby needs proper food to build up his body.
Milk is his only food for the first months of his life and
even up to three years he takes mostly milk.</p>

<p>For the first eight or nine months of a baby’s life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
mother’s milk is the best food for him, and if he is unfortunate
enough to have to take his milk from a bottle you
will have to learn the best kind of bottle to use and how
to prepare it. Baby is very particular about his milk
being fresh and good.</p>

<p>Punctual feeding makes good digestion and even if he
wants that extra nap it is better to wake a healthy baby
to give him his meal at regular hours, than to let his digestion
get out of order. Some babies are very punctual
and feel it keenly if you do not feed them at the fixed
hour. They will very likely let you know it too, and woe
betide you if they find you have not properly boiled the
bottle after each meal to sterilize it. Between meals a
little drink of water which has been boiled and cooled
(sterile water) will wash out his mouth as well as refresh
him. Do not give a baby too much food at a time,
and keep him on plain food. This applies to you as well
as to baby. When the digestion is not right the appetite
will not be good. Digestion makes the food you eat
ready to be turned into muscle and bone and brain, and
indigestion means that you have not used up the food you
ate and therefore you have those uncomfortable pains in
the middle of the night. Eat only the foods you know
you can digest comfortably.</p>

<p>By the time a child is two years old, he should have a
well varied though simple bill of fare. This may include
cereals such as well cooked oatmeal and cream of wheat,
soft boiled eggs, fresh juice, (beef) milk puddings, milk
toast, baked potatoes, apple sauce and chicken broth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">Clothing</h4>

<p>Children’s clothes should be warm but light, and where
possible should hang from the shoulders. The legs, particularly
the ankles, should be kept warm and the feet dry.</p>


<h4 class="center">Sunshine, Air and Exercise</h4>

<p>Give a baby plenty of fresh air, out of doors if you can,
avoiding drafty places. It gives him a better appetite,
makes him sleep sounder and also helps to give him rosy
cheeks, a sign of good red blood.</p>

<p>Be careful that sheet and blankets do not get over a
baby’s head; as this weight causes suffocation, so pin the
covers to the side of the bed and let him have fresh air
while he sleeps.</p>

<p>No self respecting baby would ever by himself contract
the “pacifier” habit and he should never be given a pacifier.
This article thrust into his mouth makes the upper
jaw protrude, carries germs into a baby’s mouth, sometimes
causes adenoids, is ugly to look at and finally doesn’t
really pacify.</p>

<p>It does a baby good to lie down and kick about. Crawling
and climbing exercise his muscles. Don’t let a baby
walk too soon. Bow-legs come from standing and walking
while the bones are soft; also from under-nourishment.
But if a child wants to walk, let him make the
effort; he will not pull himself up unless he wants to
try his muscles. Childhood is a time to form the body;
it cannot be altered much when you are grown up. Playtime
should not come directly after feeding or before
sleeptime.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">Illnesses</h4>

<p>What will you do when you suddenly find that baby is
ill? To call in the doctor is the first thing, that is, if there
is a doctor. But when there is no doctor! You will at
once think of all the First Aid you have learned, and
what you know of home nursing. Drugs are bad things.
You may lay up trouble for a child by giving it soothing
drugs and advertised medicines which sometimes make
the baby stupid and may cause constipation. Never neglect
the bowels if they become stopped up. This upsets
digestion, poisons the baby and may help to bring on
convulsions or other serious illnesses. If a child is suffering
from a convulsion, lay him flat with his head on a
pillow. Pat his head with cold water and put a hot bottle
at his feet. If the convulsion continues put him in a
warm bath of about 106° which is as hot as is comfortable
for your bare elbow, but you must not keep cold
cloths on his head. Use very gentle artificial respiration
not trying to straighten the arms. Of course you will
keep a baby away from anyone who has a contagious
disease.</p>

<p>You can very easily train a young child to obey, but
after three years old it becomes more difficult unless a
good start has been made. Children expect you to be
just. If you are good tempered and patient a child will
stand a good deal of firmness, but slapping and scolding
ruin young tempers. Answer a child’s question without
ridicule. He is feeling his way in this great big world,
and you once asked foolish questions, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="center">Proficiency Badges</h3>

<p>Whenever I see a Scout coming along I feel at once a
friendly interest in her, but when she comes nearer that
interest either increases or goes off a bit when I look
at her right arm and see on it badges—or no badges.</p>

<p>Every Scout, as soon as she has passed the Second
Class tests, can go in for proficiency badges. These
badges are not intended for swagger, but to show that
you can do things. On the left arm you will wear those
badges which mean that you are good at work that is
useful to other people, and these are the important
badges; while on the right arm the badges show the sort
of Scout that you are, that is whether you are efficient
or not in different branches of Scout work.</p>

<p>There are a very large number of badges on the list
which you can go in for, but it does not mean that you are
to try and get them all, but rather that you may look
through the list and find out which are most likely to
suit you and then to go in for one or two of those. The
most important of all the badges are those for nursing.
They are important to the Scout herself, because through
practising this work she can most easily carry out the
Scout law of doing good turns to other people, and these
would be good turns which really are useful. Also by
knowing how to nurse she can do good work for her
country.</p>

<p><i>The Value of Nursing.</i>—In the great war hundreds
and hundreds of women have gone to act as nurses in the
hospitals, for the wounded and have done splendid work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
They will no doubt be thankful all their lives that while
they were yet girls they learnt how to nurse and how to
do hospital work, so that they were useful when the call
came for them. But there are thousands and thousands
of others who wanted to do the work when the time came,
but they had not like Scouts been Prepared, and they
had never learnt how to nurse, and so they were perfectly
useless and their services were not required in the
different hospitals. So carry out your motto and Be
Prepared and learn all you can about hospital and child
nursing, sick nursing, and every kind, while you are yet
a Scout and have people ready to instruct you and to help
you in learning.</p>

<p>Child nursing is also very important, because so many
girls are wanted now to help mothers in looking after
their children. Such a large number of babies die every
year from being nursed by girls who have never taken the
trouble to learn what they ought to do with children.
Babies are delicate little things, and a very little act of
carelessness or want of knowledge of what to do often
causes the death of one who might otherwise have grown
up to be a valuable citizen for the country. On becoming
a Scout you promise to Be Prepared to do your duty
in every possible way, and one very important way is that
of nursing children as well as grown ups; and therefore
I hope that you will learn as quickly as possible how to
carry out this duty and so to carry out your work as a
Scout in the proper spirit. Therefore I recommend you
to take as the most important ones, the Ambulance Badge,
the Child Nurse Badge, and the Home Nursing; after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
which you can look through the list and pick out others
for which you feel that you are particularly keen, or for
which there are instruction classes for Scouts that you
can attend. Set those badges up before you and do your
best to win some of them.</p>

<p><i>Where to wear the Badges.</i>—The First and Second
Class Badge is worn <i>on the left arm</i>. It should be placed
about half-way between the elbow and the
shoulder strap, so as not to be covered by the
shoulder knot.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 102px;">
<img src="images/i_204.jpg" width="102" height="138" alt="BE PREPARED badge" />
</div>

<p>The Ambulance, Home Nurse, and Child
Nurse Badges are also worn on the left arm,
just below the Second and First Class Badges.
All the other Proficiency Badges are worn on the right
arm. They are sewn on as they are won, starting at the
bottom of the sleeve, just above the cuff, and growing
upwards in couples as the Scout becomes more and more
proficient.</p>

<p>The War Service Badge is worn above the right-hand
breast pocket.</p>

<p>The Attendance Stars are worn in a horizontal row
just above the left-hand breast pocket.</p>

<p><i>The War Service Badge.</i>—Is granted to Scouts who
have done special service for their country during the
Great War. It is worn above the right breast pocket.</p>


<h4 class="center">Golden Eaglet</h4>

<p>To secure this honor a Girl Scout must win the following
badges: Ambulance and First Aid, Clerk, Cook,
Child Nurse, Dairymaid, Matron, Musician, Needlewoman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Naturalist, Home Nurse, Pathfinder, Pioneer,
Signaler, Swimmer, Athletics, Health or Civics. (In case
a swimming badge is impossible two badges not already
earned may be substituted.)</p>


<h4 class="center">Life-Saving Medals</h4>

<p>These are worn on the right breast and are awarded
as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Bronze Cross (Red Ribbon).</i>—Presented as the highest
possible award for gallantry. It can only be worn
where the claimant has shown special heroism or has faced
extraordinary risk of life in saving life.</p>

without grave risks to herself.</p>

<p><i>Thanks Badge.</i>—It is the privilege of any Scout, of
whatever rank, to present this Badge of Thanks to any
one who does a Scout a good turn. It entitles the wearer
to make use of the services of any Scout at any time,
but does not constitute membership.</p></div>


<h4 class="center">Hockey a Fine Game</h4>

<p>I should like to see everything that calls itself a girl
playing it. Yet there are thousands and thousands of
girls who have never yet even seen it played—much
less played it themselves.</p>

<p>I should like all of them to play it, not only once but
regularly, and this is why.</p>

<p>Because it gives them health and strength through active
exertion in the open air; it gives them a jolly time and
lots of excitement, happiness, and laughter; it makes them
quick with eye, hand, and foot; it makes them all good pals
together; it teaches them to take hard knocks without
winking such as at other times would make them faint or
swear.</p>

<p>It teaches them to play unselfishly and to pass the ball
on. It gives them pluck, it gives them hope, for even
when things look bad there is often the possibility of
winning by an extra effort. They learn to stick to rules
and to obey orders, to play fair and to stop sneaking,
underhand play.</p>

<p>In a word, they learn to play the game for their side
and not for themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, that is just what our soldiers at the front are
doing, playing the game nobly for their country at no
matter what danger to their own life or limb.</p>

<p>It’s just what we want of all Americans in the future—women
as well as men—to think of their country and
other people first; to obey the laws and play the game for
the good of others bravely and hopefully, without caring
what hard knocks they get themselves.</p>

<p>Could not some of you who can afford to play hockey
yourselves managed to help some other girls to play it too?</p>

<p>Think what joy it would bring into their lives, what
health and brightness you could offer them and what
good and friendly citizens you could make them.</p>


<h4 class="center">A Scout Is a Lady</h4>

<p><i>What is a Lady?</i>—This is what I saw the other day
in the Subway. The seats were all crowded when a
smart-looking girl got in. A wounded soldier with a
bandaged foot and a walking stick stood up rather painfully
and offered her his seat. The girl plumped herself
down comfortably and she did not give him a look or
even a word of thanks. A pale woman then rose and
said to him, “I can stand better than you; you got hurt
for me,” and made him take her place.</p>

<p>One of these two women was a lady. Can you guess
which?</p>


<h4 class="center">The Frogs in the Cream</h4>

<p>Oh, there is one more thing that hockey teaches. Often
you lose a game, but you do not therefore lose your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
temper or lose your happiness for, as a Scout, you at
once cheer the winners and forget to be put out by it.</p>

<p>But you don’t lose every game. Very often it will
look as if it was going against you and there seems
little chance of winning when, just near the end, the
other side give out or get careless, and by sheer sticking
to it you win a goal or two in the last few minutes and
come out victorious in the end.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 580px;">
<img src="images/i_208.jpg" width="580" height="348" alt="frogs in bowl of cream" />
<div class="caption">Perseverance: Frogs in the cream.</div>
</div>

<p>Well, it is sticking to it which is so tremendously valuable,
not only in the game, but also for getting on as a
Scout, and afterwards in getting on in life.</p>

<p>Two frogs, out for a walk one day, came upon a bowl
of cream, into which they fell. Thinking it a new kind
of water and that it was hopeless trying to swim, one
was drowned through having no pluck. The other struggled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
hard to keep afloat. Just when he felt he <i>must</i>
give up a curious thing happened. In his struggles he
had churned up the cream so much that he found himself
standing safe on a pat of butter!</p>

<p>If you learnt nothing else from Scouting than this
little story of the frogs, try, at any rate, to remember
that; and when you feel you are failing at your job
just think of it; remind yourself of the frogs—and
stick to it.</p>


<h4 class="center">Happy Housemaids Singing Hymns</h4>

<p>Someone asked me the other day why it is that housemaids,
when they are at work, are always droning most
dreary hymn tunes. Well, I couldn’t say exactly why
they do it, but I like to hear it, because people who sing
at their work evidently don’t find it a drudgery or irksome.</p>

<p>I was at a great aeroplane factory the other day, where
the manager had encouraged his men in their spare time
to form a band, and he supplied the funds for helping
them to get instruments, music, etc.</p>

<p>When they began to get rather good at it they, like all
amateur musicians, began to fancy themselves, and said
that they would like to get some high-class classical music
to play.</p>

<p>But he said: “Not a bit of it, I want you to play all
the tunes that you can get, provided that they are jolly
ones.”</p>

<p>Then he used to make the men march to their workshops
with their band playing, and for the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
morning, instead of working sullenly and grudgingly
at their machines, the men were whistling and singing the
tunes that were running in their heads, and the work
consequently was better done and more of it was got
through than would otherwise have been possible.</p>

<p>So the wretched Girl Scouts, when they are forced to
play these dull games and to do the terrible hard work
of Scouting, need something to cheer them up. All they
have to do is to learn a few jingles and to sing them,
stamp, bang, or whistle them as they go along, and they
are sure to feel the better for it.</p>


<h4 class="center">Patrol Leaders</h4>

<p>When you come to be a Patrol Leader you must remember
that you are really taking up a very responsible
and important position, because you are going to be in
charge of a number of girls under you, who will form
their characters entirely under your example and guidance,
and if you choose to be a slacker they will become
slackers, if you choose to be a good Scout they will all
become good Scouts, or nearly all of them. That is very
much dependent on you yourself. So don’t become a
Patrol Leader merely for the swagger of it or the sake
of wearing an extra badge or two, but really think whether
you are fitted to lead those girls, and take it up with
the best of your ability to make good Scouts of them.
You have got to <i>command</i> your Patrol; well, you can
only command others if you have their confidence, and
you can only have their confidence if you have confidence
in yourself; you can only have confidence in yourself by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
knowing your work thoroughly and well. You should
therefore study the handbook, learn all about Scouting,
what it aims for, and then how you can carry out the
instructions given; practise the things yourself that are
shown you, know that you can do the different things well;
and then you will be able to have confidence in yourself,
your Scouts will obey your orders, and so you will be able
to carry out the training of them and their discipline perfectly
well. You lead entirely by your own personal example,
don’t forget that; that is what tells, and that is
the easy way to gain success; not only the easy way, but
it is the <i>only</i> way.</p>

<p>As a Leader you must be the best at carrying out the
Scout Law in your Patrol, the others will follow you in
it; you must be the captain also in all the games; you
must be the first in every venture; you must be the one
to suggest good games, good ideas, good thoughts. If
you are the first in every way like this your girls will
follow your leads and you will have good discipline among
them. Your aim should, of course, be to make your
Patrol the best, and if every Patrol tries to be the best in
the Troop, you may be sure that that Troop will be a
very good one amongst other Troops.</p>

<p>You should take counsel among your Scouts as to
what they fancy themselves at, and then challenge another
Patrol to have a competition in that particular line,
whatever it may be, whether Signalling, or Ambulance
Work, or playing a game of Hockey, or baseball, or anything
you like; but continually challenge other Patrols
to beat you at your own game, and then practise your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
game well and make yourselves efficient at it, so as you
do not get beaten. For every game the whole Patrol
should form the team. Don’t have one or two good
players and the rest no use at all; and don’t have individual
competition, one girl against another, but always
try and have your Patrol as a team, then the worst
will try and make themselves better in order to play up
the average of the lot, and so play for the good of the
Patrol and not of themselves. If possible, give each of
your Scouts her own job to do in the Patrol. You may
find one good at one thing, another good at another;
well, urge her to do her particular job, and to do it
well for the benefit and honour of the Patrol. You will
have one little difficult point that you must keep an eye
on; when you are trying to lead the Patrol and at the
same time to show them the way, don’t forget that you
must not do the work of other girls. Give each one her
job and see that she does it, but don’t do it for her, or else
she will always be leaning on you and expecting you
to do it.</p>

<p>A Patrol can specialise, that is, all members to take
one special badge, or a bit of ribbon will do, that a Patrol
may be a Despatch Riding Patrol, or a Signalling Patrol,
First Aid Patrol, a Home Helping Patrol, or even an
Entertaining Patrol. All the members of the Patrol win
a certain Proficiency Badge, then that Patrol may be
recommended by the Captain to have the honour of wearing
that badge on its flag. I have known a great deal
of good to come of a Patrol challenging a Patrol in another
Troop to some sort of competition, and then going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to visit the other Patrol or inviting them to visit themselves
at their own headquarters and entertaining them
and having their competition and making great friends
with them; this leads to very good feeling between different
Troops, and is very useful, because you can
often pick up ideas from Patrols of another Troop better
than you can from one of your own Troops. In camp a
Patrol is a very useful unit because a whole Patrol can
just pitch into one tent or probably into one room or
barn, or wherever it may be, and there the Patrol Leader’s
duties are very responsible, because she has to keep
order in her own tent and see that it is properly kept clean
and tidy.</p>


<h4 class="center">Example of an English Display</h4>

<p><i>A Scout Hostel.</i>—Scene: Inside a Scout Headquarters,
fitted with bed, stretcher table, cooking stove, cupboard,
Scout Law, etc.</p>

<p>Patrol at right of stage learning electricity and telegraphy.</p>

<p>Patrol at left of stage bathing, dressing, and feeding
model baby.</p>

<p>In centre Brownies learning a dance; all under their
Patrol Leaders to demonstrate the method of instruction
in the Scouts.</p>

<p>After short demonstration one of the telegraph Scouts
stops all work by saying that she has intercepted a wireless
message saying “Air raid coming on.”</p>

<p>Patrols immediately fall in under their leaders, one as
stretcher party and the other as first-aiders, with haversacks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
etc., and march out to render assistance to police,
etc.</p>

<p>Brownies, meantime, clear up the place, make bed
ready, get out lint and bandages, etc., from cupboards, boil
up kettle, put away electrical apparatus, etc.</p>

<p>Re-enter Scout leading a fat old lady, telling her she
will be quite safe here. Old lady very flustered and very
grateful. Brownies take charge of her, giving her a
chair, and make her comfortable. As the Scout goes out
the old lady calls after her and tells her she has dropped
her handbag somewhere in the street. Doesn’t know
where, dare not go out to look for it, but hopes that the
Scout will; which she does smilingly.</p>

<p>Wretched woman with baby and crying children
brought in next by another Scout, and made comfortable
by Brownies. Fussy old gentleman, cantankerous old
woman also come hustling in, led by Scouts, some lost
children are brought in howling, also any number of
other characters can be devised among your actors, including
one man who will insist on making speeches
against the Government for not stopping these raids.</p>

<p>When the room becomes full of them they all keep talking
at once of their various grievances, and the children
howling; bombs are heard without (bang of a drum or
box full of old tins dropped), at each side of which all
shriek, are silent for a moment or two, and then recommence
their jabber.</p>

<p>Finally, half the Scouts having returned, they set to
work to prepare food and hand it round to the people,
which very soon quiets them, except the speech-maker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
who seizes the opportunity of the others becoming quiet
to make his speech with greater fervor. The Scouts stop
him by putting a sack over his head and bundling him
into a corner.</p>

<p>Then the stretcher party bring in an injured person,
who is bandaged and put to bed. Others have slight
wounds bound up and treated, and the Scouts then set
to work with rugs and blankets and make beds on the
floor for the whole party.</p>

<p>They then all go to bed comfortably on the floor.</p>

<p>Two Scouts remain on duty, the others lying down to
sleep also.</p>

<h4 class="center">Hints as to Camp Orders</h4>

<p><i>In going into camp it is essential to have a few “Standing
Orders” published, which can be added to from time
to time, if necessary. These should be carefully explained
to patrol leaders, who should then be held fully
responsible for their Scouts carrying them out exactly.</i></p>

<p><i>Such orders might point out that each patrol will camp
separately from the others, and that there will be a comparison
between the respective cleanliness and good order
of tents and surrounding ground.</i></p>

<p><i>Patrol leaders to report on the good work or otherwise
of their Captains, which will be recorded in the Captain’s
books of marks.</i></p>

<p><i>Bathing under strict supervision to prevent non-swimmers
getting into dangerous water. No girl must bathe
when not well.</i>><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bathing picket of two good swimmers will be on duty
while bathing is going on, and ready to help any girl
in distress. This picket will be in the boat (undressed)
with bathing costume and overcoat on. They may only
bathe when the general bathing is over and the last of
the bathers has left the water.</i></p>

<p><i>Orders as to what is to be done in case of fire alarm.</i></p>

<p><i>Orders as to boundaries, grounds to be worked over,
damages to fences, property, good drinking water, etc.</i></p>

<p><i>No Scout allowed out of bounds without leave.</i></p>

<p><i>No boy allowed inside bounds without leave.</i></p>

<div class="caption">Loafing on the pier.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Even</span> before the war came girls had begun to find
that there were better things in the world for them to
do than merely spend half their time
in getting up their dresses and the
other half in showing them off: there
was enjoyment to be got without
playing tennis, reading novels and so
on; some of them had supposed that
going to dances or loafing on the pier
or in the street was the only way to
get enjoyment, but others saw that
this was really a great waste of time
that became very boring after a bit.
A vast number of them had seen that
they were capable of doing a great
many of the things that their brothers
could do: they could play in a lot of
games and take part in activities and also could do a good
deal in the direction of work and handcraft, also they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
found that they could do well in professions and industries;
they found that careers were open to them.
Girls found at last that they had the power to make
some use of their lives instead of drifting through them
aimlessly and getting only a very hollow enjoyment out
of them.</p>



<h3>THE CITIZEN SCOUT</h3>

<p>One of the most notable English statesman said in the
fourth year of the Great War:</p>

<p>“I am anxious to bear testimony to the tremendous part
played by the women in England in this vital epoch of
human history. They have not only borne their burden
of sorrow and separation with unflinching fortitude and
patience but they have an enormous share of the burdens
necessary to the practical conduct of the war.</p>

<p>“To their ennobling influence we look not only for
strength to win the war, but for inspiration during the
great work of reconstruction we will have to undertake
after victory is won.”</p>

<p>This is becoming true in American also. Never before
have our national ideals been so clearly defined;
never before have we realized the relative values of
life.</p>

<p>One hundred years ago democracy was a masculine
noun. Women worked loyally in the home for husband,
son and brother. The war came and suddenly they
found themselves working for all men who were holding
high the ideals of the American home and the American
nation. By assuming these responsibilities, women have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
entered unconsciously into active citizenship from which
there is no retreat.</p>

<p>The great experiment is here. American girls are
showing that they are made of the same stuff as their
sturdy forefathers, and by thousands are entering untried
and difficult fields and finding themselves capable
of doing a great many things that their brothers and
fathers have heretofore done. Handcraft, industries and
professions have all been opened to young women. They
are working in farm and field, factory and railway, bank
and business office, hospital and camp, canteen and reconstruction.
Girls and women with clear heads and adaptability
are entering in amazing numbers into business and
professional life, proving that their brains are not inferior
to those of men. They have been keen to take
up new tasks and quick to learn unfamiliar processes and
their employers have been generous in acknowledging
that skill comes only with practice.</p>

<p>But the authorities found on examining women for their
new employments, that the lack was not entirely or
fundamentally that of technical training but that a preliminary
course was needed particularly in health knowledge
and in discipline. These things would have been
useful in any line of work, whether for war or for peace,
and we are now awake to the necessity of such training.
If a girl is to be equally efficient with her brother
for work in the world, she must be given equal chances
with him, equal chances for gaining character and skill
discipline and bodily health, and equal chances for using
these when she has got them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore the Citizen Scout was started, in order that
girls with a sound body and disciplined mind should be
able to help their country in many different ways after
this tremendous world struggle.</p>

<p>Every Citizen Scout should have a vocation which she
has chosen and by which she can support herself. If
one can work at some congenial employment all the better,
but even an apparently stupid occupation can be
made interesting by a realization of the part it plays in
the world of industry by which we all live, and one can
get great pleasure out of work well done, even if it is
only oiling a machine successfully. Wouldn’t it make
the daily labor more interesting to combine head with
hand? For instance to put heads on pins all day long
in a factory sounds monotonous, but the people to whom
pin making is interesting find out what pins are made of,
where the metal is found, how many things pins are used
for; what people used as substitutes before pins were
made. Once in England, a man took so small a thing as
a needle for the subject of a play which has been well
known ever since; Gammer Gurton’s Needle. The machines
which make the pins and needles are to-day marvels
of skill developed through centuries of patient labor
of head and hand. Farm labor is toilsome, but the life
of the race depends on the products of field and pasture,
and the Citizen Scout who works on the land is helping
to feed the world.</p>

<p>But success in an industrial or professional career is
neither the end nor the greatest joy of a girl’s life.
Home making is after all the vocation which calls most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
naturally and most deeply to a woman and is most worthy
of her best efforts. However independent and self reliant
a girl may be, the finding of her life comrade, the
settling of her own home and the bringing up of her
little ones are the biggest happiness that can be had in
this world. Nature never meant a man or woman to
live alone, and though bachelors may think themselves
happy and free, they cannot realize the intense delight
that comes with the home, the married comradeship and
the children. There a woman has her real opportunity
and her kingdom, and at the same time her responsibility.
She is the making or the marring of the house, and her
influence will rule her children all through their after
life. If she recognizes this and shoulders her duty
with that idea in mind she can in forming her children’s
character do a tremendous thing for each of them and
a valuable service for the nation.</p>

<p>But to be the right sort of comrade to her husband
and her children a girl must have known work herself.
She must have gone through the struggle against failure
and have enjoyed the triumph of success to be able fully
to sympathize with her partner in his troubles and to be
of use in helping him through them. A house mother is
a money spender not a money getter, and her work is
really much harder than his. A wise educator has said:
“I will undertake to guarantee the stability of our American
democratic institutions if you will see to it that
American wives are taught how best to spend the money
their husbands earn. Somewhere in that last ten per
cent of a man’s income are hidden away his present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
happiness and future prospects,” and those of his
children.</p>

<p>The women of America must see to it that as far as
lies in their power the vast resources of this great country
are carefully conserved and wisely expended.</p>

<p>To be a valuable citizen the first qualification is an
understanding of the organization and administration of
one’s government. With more knowledge of the principles
for which our government really stands there will
come to the thinking American girl a desire to help
definitely in the administration of those principles. Real
social service will develop every Citizen Scout, give her
a broader vision of life, awaken her sympathy and
clear her intellect so that when she casts her vote she
will do it with intelligence and with civic pride.</p>


<h4 class="center">Qualifications for Citizen Scouts</h4>

<p>To become a Citizen Scout a girl must be 17 years
old, or over, and she must declare her belief in the civic
ideals of:</p>

<p>1. Good health—by trying to attain the Girl Scout
standard of physical health.</p>

<p>2. Vocational Skill—by being willing to perfect herself
in some work by which she can earn her living.</p>

<p>3. Public Service—by pledging herself to some public
service, either individually or in her troop.</p>

<p>Any Girl Scout over seventeen shall be eligible for
promotion to “Citizen Scout.” When there are enough
Citizen Scouts in any troop they may form a Citizen
Scout patrol under their own patrol leader, in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
troop where they were formerly Scouts, or separate
troops of Citizen Scouts may be formed if desired, either
by ex-Scouts or by young women who have not been
Scouts before. The number of members for Citizen
Scout patrol or troop is not limited. One member will
be elected Troop leader, and other officers may be elected
as found desirable. A Troop may, if it likes, choose a
member of the Local Committee or any woman in the
community in whose sympathy and judgment they have
confidence to act as “counsellor and friend.” Or they
may refer to the local director or to the chairman of
Girl Scout Captain Association when any difficulty arises,
or they may be quite independent of any control outside
of their own troop, except the Council and Local Committee.</p>

<p>A Citizen Scout troop may adopt any crest of the list
authorized by Headquarters but a crest is not obligatory.</p>

<p>Each Citizen Scout must pay an annual registration
fee of 25 cents to National Headquarters.</p>

<p>A Citizen Scout is expected to make the regular Girl
Scout promise and in addition to accept for herself the
three ideals of good citizenship.—Good Health, Vocational
Skill, and Public Service.</p>

<p>Motto, “Be Prepared.”</p>

<p>Badge: The Trefoil. To the Citizen Scout the badge
stands not only for the three parts of the Scout promise,
but also for the three civic ideals.</p>

<p>Citizen Scouts use the regular Girl Scout Salute.
(See <a href="#Page_65">p. 65</a>.)</p>

<p>The uniform consists of:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>


<ul class="smallin">
<li>Khaki long coat (or Norfolk suit).</li>
<li>Khaki hat.</li>
</ul>



<p>G.S. (Girl Scout) on collar, or coat lapels.</p>

<p>Hat band with Tenderfoot badge on it.</p>

<p>Instead of the full uniform a Citizen Scout may wear
a brassard of khaki with stencilled trefoil and letters
G.S. to which she may add the crest of her troop. The
Troop leader’s insignia is a ¼ inch red ribbon around the
left arm above elbow. This may be put on uniform or
brassard.</p>

<p>Citizen Scouts may work for the same proficiency
badges as Girl Scouts. They are recommended to qualify
for the progressive badge, especially if they have already
won the Proficiency badges.</p>

<p>A Citizen Scout who has been a Girl Scout may continue
wearing her badge or she may wear the stripes to
indicate the number of badges secured. One stripe denotes
five badges; two stripes denote ten, and three denote
fifteen badges.</p>


<h4 class="center">Citizen Scout Ideals</h4>

<p>Under the three civic ideals of Good Health, Vocational
Skill and Public Service certain activities are suggested
from which the Citizen Scout may choose.</p>


<p class="unindent">I. “<span class="smcap">I will make myself physically perfect.</span>”</p>

<p>The Government requires that its employees shall pass
a physical examination to determine their fitness for
service. It is strongly recommended that every Citizen
Scout shall determine her own physical fitness by a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
examination given by some competent physician. In this
way she may discover any weakness or defect and remedy
it by exercise, rest or medical care. An annual examination
of one’s body is a strong asset for a long life.</p>

<p>The best body to have is one which is in such good
health that its owner does not need to think about it.
It serves her constantly and faithfully. The rules for
keeping such a servant are:</p>


<ul class="smallin">
<li>Absolute cleanliness in body and clothing.</li>
<li>Daily exercise and rest in proper amounts.</li>
<li>Sufficient good plain food at regular intervals.</li>
<li>Plenty of fresh air and sunshine.</li></ul>

<p class="unindent">A Citizen Scout should have a definite knowledge of
personal health and of her own physical constitution and
powers; should know the dangers of disease, and the
effects of the social evil.</p>

<p>A Citizen Scout should also understand the health
conditions in her own neighborhood and have full information
as to food, water, and milk supply, the ashes
and garbage disposal, street cleaning and other matters
relating to the public health in her community.</p>


<h4 class="center">Suggested Activities</h4>

<p>Gymnasium Exercises.</p>

<p>Organized sports and games, with teams for competitions
against other Scout troops, Y. W. C. A. Jewish
Alliance, schools, colleges or other organizations.</p>

<p>Troop hikes, indoor social games, and dancing.</p>

<p>Debates, talks by public health officers, readings on
topics relating to household and civic sanitation. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
should be linked up with some sort of actual community
public health work such as milk or food inspection, school
inspection, work of visiting nurse and school doctor,
anti-tuberculosis campaigns, etc.</p>


<ul class="smallin"><li>Advanced First Aid.</li>
<li>Advanced Home Nursing.</li>
<li>Badges: Ambulance.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Athletics.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Public Health.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Home Nursing.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Special Health Award</span></li>
</ul>



<h5>Special Health Award</h5>

<p>Citizen Scouts who attain to the Girl Scout standard
of health shall be known as Super Scouts or Senior
Scouts, and they shall be allowed to arrange the Girl
Scout inter-troop athletic meets and competitions, calling
upon the various captains of Girl Scout troops in the
community and also Citizen Scouts to furnish girls to
make up the teams. The Citizen Scouts may coach teams
and shall act as umpires and referees in the games.</p>


<p class="unindent">II. “<span class="smcap">I will be able to earn my own living.</span>”</p>

<p>Among the subjects Citizen Scouts may take up are
nursing, child nursing, wood working, metal working,
design, interior decoration, stenographer, typewriting,
journalism, telegraphy, dress-design, dressmaking, salesmanship,
cooking, marketing, farming, gardening, and
all varieties of trades.</p>

<p>Groups of Citizen Scouts would find much pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and profit, if they would undertake some quite different
line from their daily occupation such as basket making,
modeling, pottery, book-binding, upholstery, or any other
branch of industrial or fine arts.</p>

<p>If a troop of Citizen Scouts wishes to study industrial
problems in their own trade or trades where other girls
are employed, meetings may be arranged between the
groups of girls in the different occupations. A sympathetic
understanding of others needs will tend to create
a better social stability. Self perfection and vocational
advancement need not necessarily lead to selfishness and
fancied superiority. In these discussions or debates outsiders
may be invited to take part. A successful business
woman might come to give her experience and help in
the discussion. A troop scrap book of clippings from
newspapers and magazines showing what is going on in
the industrial world will be of interest.</p>

<h5>Special Vocational Award</h5>

<p><i>Home maker.</i>—To win this a Citizen Scout must hold
the cook, laundress, needlewoman, housekeeper, and home
nurse’s badges, and must actually take charge of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
home for a period of three months, keeping the accounts,
and superintending all the housework that is done when
she cannot do it all herself.</p>

<p><i>Industrial Worker.</i>—To win this badge a Citizen Scout
must support herself for at least three months, and bring
a certificate from her employer to prove she has done this.</p>


<p class="unindent">III. “<span class="smcap">I will serve my country.</span>”</p>

<p>Each Citizen Scout troop should when possible, take up
some definite form of public service. When such group
work is not possible, each individual can find real public
service opportunities open in any number of fields.</p>

<p>Scouting gets its “punch” from actual participation
in doing things worth while. Therefore, use study clubs,
lectures, books, etc.; as may be necessary but base your
tests on actual deeds performed. First a follower
(learner) and then a leader. A Citizen Scout can observe
and study law-making in progress in a local board
of supervisors of a county or city council or state legislature;
or report on a session of court covering at least
one full legal case. She might visit the freight terminal,
and follow the milk delivery to the door of the consumer;
or find a voluntary job in a creche, hospital or
old ladies’ home, and do something worth while for
thirty hours. She might attend a meeting of the School
Board; help with school luncheons, and follow the work
of the school nurse in the home. Any girl who will
follow up any department of government and actually
take part in it for a week—whether in street cleaning
or reading to blind old ladies—will always thereafter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
have a different attitude toward civic affairs in that
field.</p>

<p>Each Citizen Scout should find her own field and cultivate
it: devote so many hours actual participation and
report on it; develop qualities of leadership for her
patrol; assist a captain of younger Girl Scout troop;
take over the village park, the care of a public library,
provide summer outings for poor children, conduct a
camp, helping a teacher, etc. District nursing offers many
chances for voluntary effort. Sunday school teaching,
Y. W. C. A. work, Girl’s Friendly Societies, Big Sisters,
all provide good opportunities. Red Cross and other
patriotic organizations need helpers. No one should live
to herself alone these days. Your country needs <small>YOU</small>
now—not next week or when you have leisure, but <small>NOW</small>.
The girl who doesn’t respond never will be worth what
she might be. What are you going to do about it? Do it
now!</p>


<h4 class="center">Badges</h4>


<ul class="smallin"><li>Public Health.</li>
<li>Civics.</li></ul>

<p><i>Special Civic Award.</i>—Must hold a civics badge, and
carry out some definite investigation of civic matters,
and report on it in an article of 500 words or more, or
must carry through some public service for a period
of at least three months.</p>

<p>The Badges are similar to those for Girl Scouts with
a red border round them.</p>

<p>Badges are also given to girls who qualify in technical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
or continuation schools, or in some cases in their now
factories or workshops. These are grouped as follows:</p>

When a Student passes a higher examination of the technical
school, she obtains a further Badge of a crown to
add to the stripe.</p>

<p>In many places the leaders of Scout troops have felt the
need of more training for the work they were doing with
their girls, and so Training Schools have been established,
or classes have been organized under the auspices of a
local Council. In some cases regular troops of older girls
have been organized for the purpose of training them to be
Girl Scout leaders. Such “Officers’ Training Troops”
offer excellent opportunities for girls to learn all the
Scout practices and activities, and at the same time how
to manage troops, by the best possible method—that of
actually doing it.</p>


<h4 class="center">Discipline</h4>

<p>In training yourself to be an officer you will recognise
that in order to command obedience you have yourself to
understand how to obey. It is only by practising your
own self-discipline that you will see how to develop it in
others.</p>


<h4 class="center">Responsibility</h4>

<p>As an officer you will be a responsible person in authority.
You will not have others to turn to for instruction,
you will have to devise your own plans and to put them
into action for yourself. You will be <i>trusted</i> and <i>expected</i>
to do these things.><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">Sympathy and Fairness</h4>

<p>In dealing with those under you you must have sympathy
with each individual. Each one of them has a different
mind and a different capacity; this you have to take
into account, and you must remember that success will
only come where you get their whole-hearted enthusiasm
for the work. The successful officer never drives—she
leads.</p>


<h4 class="center">Leadership</h4>

<p>So the Scout officer leads her girls by her own example,
whether it is in</p>

<h4 class="center">The Joy of Scouting</h4>

<p>Now after reading this don’t, for goodness’ sake, drop
your jaw and think that “this is not the sort of thing you
want to learn in becoming a Cadet.” There is no need to
be downhearted because there is a serious side underlying
all the jollity of Scout games. Quite the opposite.
Scout games and practices are just as lively and exciting
as any others, but they bring greater enjoyment in the
end. Why? Because after all, when you have played
your tennis or your golf, your hockey or even your humble
hopscotch, you begin to think it was very jolly but
there was something lacking; what <i>good</i> did it do to anyone?
It was to some extent time wasted. The worst
agony of death at the moment when the sands are running
out and minutes are precious is the feeling that so
many hours of life have been wasted on things that did
not matter.</p>

<h2>PART IV<br />

<small>CAPTAINS</small></h2>



<h3>WHAT IS GIRL SCOUTING?</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Girl Scouts are a Sisterhood. This means that
members of it, from top to bottom, are working together
as sisters—elder and younger sisters—from joy of the
work. It is not a small army composed of officers, non-commissioned
officers and privates in their respective
grades directing or directed under imposed instruction,
therefore the title of Captain and Lieutenant, which, although
adopted in the Association, does not exactly describe
their rôle, so I shall in these notes refer to the
seniors of all grades as I always think of them, viz. as
the Captains—those who, like elder sisters, show the
younger ones how “to turn to the right and keep straight
on.” The secret of successful execution of a scheme or
of an order is that those to whom it is imparted should
not merely have the statement but understand the meaning
that underlies it. So I would propose here—without
any idea of instructing my grandchildren how to
masticate hen products—to help them to understand
some of the methods of our movement so that those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
are interested may the more easily take up the work of
guiding girls in this happy sisterhood.</p>


<h4 class="center">The Need</h4>

<p>That nation comes to the fore which has the most character
in its citizens. It deserves its supremacy only when
that character is a good character. The character of a
nation is not merely that of a few leaders but of the
majority of the people. Character is largely a matter
of environment and training, and, later on, of experience.
Undoubtedly the mother’s influence gives as a
rule the first impetus to character. A mother cannot give
that which she does not possess herself. Therefore it is
all-important that the mothers of our country should
possess character of a high quality in order to inculcate
it in their children. Hitherto the girls, some of the
future mothers of our race, have had little character
training as a direct part of their education. Character
includes self-reliance, self-discipline, cheerfulness, consideration
for others, sense of duty, patriotism, and
other such moral qualities. But there are other things
besides character needed to make a citizen, especially:</p>


<ul class="smallin">
<li>Skill in handicraft or other work.</li>
<li>Sense of duty and service for others.</li>
<li>Physical health and knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is on these four lines therefore that the training of
the Girl Scouts is carried out, through games and practices
which appeal to the girls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">What Need Is There for It?</h4>

<p>1. War has shown how valuable women can be to the
country and to themselves if only trained.</p>

<p>2. Also peace has shown how far from happy life can
be for some unless they are trained. From want of
proper training preventable misery exists among a very
large class. This is to be seen in the squalor in our
great cities, in the poverty and unhappiness, the infant
mortality, the preventable diseases and social diseases
due to ignorance, carelessness, and generally to want of
character.</p>


<h4 class="center">Is Not Education Good Enough?</h4>

<p>No. Though it is very good and vastly improved of
late years and probably better than that of any other
nation, yet it cannot under existing conditions entirely
prepare the girl for what is possible for her in the
present day, much less for what will be required of her in
the near future. The remedy largely needed is formation
of character. Character is formed more by the
environment outside the school walls than by the instruction
within them; that environment may be for good
and at the same time it may very easily be for bad.</p>

<p>Practical efficiency in homecraft or in mothercraft is
essential, but efficiency is desirable in many other spheres
for professions, and in the many fields in which woman
has proved that she can shine.</p>

<p>The need of health for herself and knowledge of health
for her children and for the service for others is essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
on a far more general scale than has been heretofore
possible through school training alone.</p>


<h4 class="center">Sense of Duty to Others</h4>

<p>Though the war has brought a splendid exhibition of
self-sacrifice and devotion on the part of women and a
desire to be helpful and patriotic, the sense of service is
one which requires further education in the rising generation.
The results of such training can only mean a
stronger patriotism and a sound practical Christianity instead
of a mere profession.</p>



<h3>WHAT REMEDY IS PROPOSED?</h3>

<p>The aim of the Girl Scout Movement is to assist parents
and school teachers by supplying the desirable environment
and healthy activities outside the school. The first
thing is to attract the girls by happy comradeship, neat
uniform, games and competitions which will appeal to
them. Then through these to develop in them the four
points which I have mentioned as “essential.” But
please don’t think that we want to make a school of
it. My harping on the “training” may lead you to
think so. We do not want to trespass on the school
teacher’s ground nor to adopt school curricula or examination
systems. Quite the contrary. The weak point
of modern education is that though it recognises the
value of more up-to-date subjects it has not yet broken
away from old methods in presenting them to the child.
Till it does so it will remain Instruction instead of Education.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Our object in the Scouts is to supply healthy play
and recreation: but play when organised need not be waste
of time. In these days we cannot afford, nor is it fair
on them, to let children waste time and then to launch
them “half-baked” into the sea of life-troubles. The
Scout training offers them ideals and activities which
supplement, without tiring them, the teaching of the
school.</p>

<p>Results and experience of five years shows that the
scheme is successful in attracting girls of every class in
every part of the world. It can be applied equally well
in town or country and it helps rather than interferes with
every form of religion. Where properly handled it gives
remarkable and satisfactory results in the directions
looked for.</p>



<h3>WHAT IS THE ORGANISATION?</h3>



<h3>A.—NATIONAL COUNCIL</h3>

<p>The National Council is the governing body of the
Girl Scout organization. It is composed of delegates
from Local Councils and of other elected members. It
holds one meeting a year to elect officers and the members
of the Executive Board, and to decide matters that
concern the policy and welfare of the entire organization.</p>


<h4 class="center">Duties</h4>

<p>The duties of the National Council are to</p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p>Charter Local Councils, to commission officers,
and register Scouts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a><br /><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Manufacture and copyright the Badges.</p>

<p>Select uniforms and other equipment.</p>

<p>Determine the general policies and lay down the
lines of Girl Scout training.</p></div>

<p>These functions are carried out by an Executive Board
between the annual meetings of the National Council.
The National Headquarters and a staff of workers are

<h4 class="center">Executive Board</h4>

<p>The Executive Board works through Committees,
which act as advisers to the board in matters concerning
Field, Standards, Uniforms, Business, Education, Editorial,
Publicity, etc. Final action is in the hands of the
Executive Board, which is responsible to the National
Council.</p>


<h4 class="center">National Headquarters</h4>

<p>National Headquarters is divided into departments for
the more efficient handling of the work. The head of
the office staff is the National Director.</p>

<p>The <i>Director</i> is appointed by the Executive Board, and
serves as the Secretary of the National Council, the
Executive Board and the various committees thereof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Under the authority of the Executive Board she acts as

<h3>COMMUNICATIONS</h3>

<p>Every Girl Scout, every officer and councilor, every
troop and council has the right of direct communication
with National Headquarters and in cases of dispute an
appeal may be made to the Executive Board. It is,
however, desirable that in all ordinary matters the
lines of communication to Headquarters should be as
follows:—</p>

<p>From a troop, through the Captain, or through the
troop secretary giving name and number of troop, and
name of captain.</p>

<p>Where a Local Council is established, it is the normal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
medium of communication between the captains (troop)
under its jurisdiction and National Headquarters.</p>

<p>Where a Federation or State Organization is established
it may serve as the medium of communication between
the Local Councils and National Headquarters in matters
that affect the general policy of all the Local Councils
included in it.</p>

<p>Local Councils may also communicate direct with National
Headquarters in matters that concern their own
locality.</p>



<h3>B.—FEDERATION OR STATE
ORGANIZATIONS</h3>

<p>A number of Local Councils may join together to form
a Federation for mutual support. Local Councils belonging
to it may delegate their general policy to the
Federation but retain their power to control their Councils
in local matters.</p>

<p>The officers of the Federation may be elected as required.</p>

<p>Field Captains may be employed for organizing their
work.</p>

<p>The presiding officer is the Commissioner.</p>

<p>Membership in such a Federation is voluntary.</p>

<p>Or instead of a Federation of Councils a State Organization
may be formed. The area under control will
coincide with the State of the United States.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>



<h3>C.—LOCAL COUNCILS</h3>

<p>In any community where there are Girl Scouts a Local
Council may be organized. This is a body of representative
citizens of the community (number varies according
to size of the community) who are organized for the
purpose of promoting the welfare of the Girl Scouts of
that district. They determine the policies and direct the
local work, following the rules and regulations laid down
in the official Handbook and Manual subject to the general
policies determined by the National Council or its
Executive Board. Each Chartered Local Council may
send one delegate to the National Council and one additional
delegate for every 200 registered Scouts under its
jurisdiction. The National Executive Board is the court
of last resort and every member of the Girl Scout Organization
has the right of appeal to that court. The Local
Council’s officers recommend Captains and Lieutenants
for commissions, and have the power to request their
resignation when desirable, or they may appeal to National
Headquarters to dismiss an undesirable captain.
A Local Council may ask Headquarters for the assistance
of a Field Captain.</p>

<p><i>Insignia for Local Councilors.</i> Gray and black shoulder
cord and fringe (see minutes Executive Board, April
11, 1918).</p>

<p>Gray and black hat cord.</p>

<p>The shoulder cords may be worn with any costume—the
hat cords are generally worn only with the uniform
hat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">The Commissioner</h4>

<p>Is the presiding officer of the Local Council. She is
chairman of the Local Executive Board, she is elected by
the Local Council and receives a commission from the
National Headquarters.</p>

<p><i>Duties.</i> Her duties are to secure the harmonious coöperation
of the captains in her district, to inspect Scout
patrols and troops and advise how to conduct them
according to the principles found in the Handbook, to
be the authority for recommending the issue or denial
of captains’ certificates and foster the movement generally.</p>

<p><i>Uniform.</i> Khaki Norfolk suit. Scout hat with gray
cord with gray acorns.</p>

<p><i>Insignia.</i> Gray shoulder cord and fringe (may be
worn with any costume if Commissioner prefers not to
have a uniform) (see minutes Executive Board, April
11, 1918).</p>


<h4 class="center">Officers</h4>

<p>Of Local Councils will be elected according to the needs
of the community.</p>

<h5>Deputy Commissioner</h5>

<p>Stands in the relation of vice-president to the commissioner.</p>

<p><i>Uniform.</i> Khaki Norfolk Suit. Scout hat with gray
cord with black acorns.</p>

<p><i>Insignia.</i> Gray shoulder cord with black and gray
fringe and black center, may be worn with any costume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
if the Deputy Commissioner prefers not to have a uniform
(see minutes Executive Board, April 11, 1918).</p>


<h5>District Commissioner</h5>

<p>In large communities it is possible to divide the territory
into districts each with a District Commissioner who
is responsible for the work in that district to the Commissioner.</p>

<p><i>Uniforms.</i> Khaki Norfolk Suit. Scout hat with gray
cord with gray acorns.</p>

<p><i>Insignia.</i> Black shoulder cord with black and gray
fringe with gray center. May be worn with any costume
if the District Commissioner prefers not to have a uniform.</p>


<h5>The Local Director</h5>

<p>Is the title given to the executive officer of the local
Council. (This officer was formerly called Secretary.)</p>

<p><i>Duties.</i> She has charge of Headquarters and other
property of the local organization, has general supervision
of the Captains and instructs new captains in their duties,
organizes new troops, receives and forwards to Headquarters
all applications for captains’ certificates, keeps
all records of the council and of the troops and such information
concerning them as may be necessary for the
work. She is secretary of the Committees, but her presence
at each meeting is decided by the Local Council; it
is her duty to attend public meetings connected with the
organization and she represents Girl Scouts at the meetings
of other organizations unless otherwise directed by
the Council.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Uniform.</i> Khaki Norfolk suit. Scout hat with gold
and black hat cord (see Com. on Uniforms, Jan. 12,
1918).</p>

<p><i>Insignia.</i> Four bands one-fourth-inch black braid, all
around left cuff (Com. on Standards, May 7, 1918).</p>


<h5>Local Field Captains</h5>

<p>May be employed by Local Councils for organizing
their work.</p>

<p><i>Uniform.</i> Khaki Norfolk suit. Scout hat, gold and
black hat cord (Com. on Uniforms, Jan. 12, 1918).</p>


<h5>Troops</h5>

<p><i>Insignia.</i> Three bands of one-fourth-inch black braid
all around left cuff (Com. on Standards, May 7, 1918).</p>

<p>Girl Scouts are organized in troops under the direct
charge of a Captain who may or may not have one or
more Lieutenants to assist her.</p>

<p>A troop may be of any size, although it is not advisable
for a Captain to have a troop of more than thirty girls
unless she is assisted by a capable Lieutenant.</p>


<h5>The Captain</h5>

<p>Must not be less than twenty-one years old, and must
have a personal character and standing, a good moral
influence over girls, and sufficient steadfastness of purpose
to carry out the work with energy and perseverance.
She should have a general knowledge of the Handbook,
and should appreciate the underlying aim and principles
of Girl Scout training. She must apply to National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Headquarters for her commission. Application should
be made on blanks supplied from National Headquarters
and must be endorsed by three prominent citizens of
the community. Where a Local Council is established
the application must be sent through the Local Council.
The Captain has the power to enroll Scouts, and
to release a Scout from her promise, to suspend her for
a certain period, or withdraw her badges and discharge
her. A Scout who considers herself unjustly treated
may appeal to the Local Council or even to National
Council. The Captain directs the Scout training of the
girls in her troop, and may examine them for the Tenderfoot
and Second Class tests. Where no court of honor
exists she may secure examiners for them for the special
subjects of proficiency badges or this may be done by
the Local Council.</p>

<p><i>Uniform.</i> Khaki Norfolk suit. Scout hat, gold and
black hat cord (Com. on Uniforms, Jan. 12, 1918).</p>

<p><i>Insignia.</i> Gold and black shoulder cord (Com. on
Uniforms, Jan. 12, 1918), two bands one-fourth-inch
black braid all around left cuff (Com. on Standards,
May 7, 1918).</p>

<p>Captain’s pin.</p>


<h5>Lieutenant</h5>

<p>Should not be less than 18 years of age. Her qualifications
are the same as those for Captain and she receives
her commission in the same way. She is chosen by the
Captain, performs the duties of the Captain during her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
absence and such other duties as the Captain may assign
to her.</p>

<p><i>Uniform.</i> Khaki Norfolk suit. Scout hat, gold and
black hat cord (Com. on Uniforms, Jan. 12, 1918).</p>

<p><i>Insignia.</i> One braid one-fourth-inch black braid all
around left cuff (Com. on Uniforms, May 7, 1918).</p>

<p>Lieutenant’s pin.</p>

<p>Captains and Lieutenants on making their application
to enter the organization pay a small fee which covers the
entire period of membership. Commissions are issued
for one year and must be renewed at the end of the
period.</p>



<h3>E.—PATROLS</h3>

<p>Troops are divided into <i>Patrols</i> of about eight girls
each, for convenience in work and play. One of the
eight girls is chosen <i>Patrol Leader</i> and another the <i>Corporal</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Patrol Leader</i> must be what her name implies, a
leader, for she stands next to the Captain and Lieutenant
and takes either’s place in their absence. She is responsible
for her patrol. She may be elected by the girls
themselves or appointed by the captain, with the consent
of the girls. She holds office for six months or a
year, and is eligible for reëlection. Her duties include
calling the roll, keeping records of the attendance and
dues of her patrol, and leaving the meeting place in
order. Any of these duties may be delegated to the
Corporal, or to some other member of the patrol, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
as the Patrol Leader becomes capable of assuming
heavier responsibilities, to relieve her of the routine
duties.</p>

<p><i>Uniform.</i> Regular Scout uniform.</p>

<p><i>Insignia.</i> Chevron, two stripes, on left sleeve above
elbow.</p>

<p>The Patrol Leader carries the patrol pennon.</p>

<p><i>The Corporal</i> may be elected by the patrol, appointed
by the captain or by the Patrol Leader. She takes the
latter’s place when she is absent, and performs such other
duties as may be assigned to her by the Patrol Leader or
by the Captain.</p>

<p><i>Uniform.</i> Regular Scout uniform.</p>

<p><i>Insignia.</i> Chevron, one bar; on left sleeve above elbow.</p>

<p>Want of space in the present book prevents me from
going into the details of the dress, administration, and
discipline of the Movement, but these can all be found in
the <i>Book of Rules</i>, which can be obtained from Headquarters
price 6<i>d.</i></p>


<h4 class="center">Discipline of the Movement</h4>

<p>All these rules may appear rather alarming to an outsider,
but please remember that they are “rules” as
for cricket and not “regulations” as for police purposes.
They are merely intended as indications for
“playing the game,” and that is the only form of discipline
that we ask for in the sisterhood. Their object
is to ensure that their policy is adhered to under which
our Charter of Incorporation was granted, and also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to guarantee to parents that reliable officers are in charge
of their girls to ensure fairness of standard in awards,
and to secure efficient training by having efficient Scouters.</p>


<h4 class="center">Method</h4>

<p><i>Method.</i>—Our method of training is to educate from
within rather than to instruct from without; to offer
games and activities which, while being attractive to the
girl, will seriously educate her morally, mentally, and
physically.</p>

<p>Our aim is to promote “not so much the acquisition of
knowledge as the desire and capacity for acquiring knowledge.”</p>

<p>In other words, the Captain’s job is to enthuse the
girl in the right direction. By acting on this principle
she will save herself considerable trouble in reaching her
goal and in producing smart, keen and capable girls.</p>

<p>It is the means by which the modern schoolmistress
scores over her more old-fashioned sister, since she develops
a girl to be efficient rather than scholarly, to have
character rather than erudition—and that is what counts
towards success in life nowadays.</p>

<p>By “efficiency” I don’t mean mere money-making
skill, but a general intelligence and capability to live a
free, prosperous and happy life.</p>

<p>To preach “don’t” is to incite the doing of wrong.
Rather infuse the right spirit; as powder is to the shot,
so is spirit to action.</p>

<p><i>Moral Instruction.</i>—Direct moral instruction—like
drill—produces a pleasing veneer, but unless there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
properly seasoned character below this will not stand
wear.</p>

<p>Wise old Plato long ago gave us the right lead in education,
and one which only now is beginning to be followed,
when he said that there was innate good in every
child, and the aim of education should be to develop these
natural “instincts of virtue” through suitable practices.</p>

<p><i>Active versus passive education.</i>—No mention of reading,
writing, and ’rithmetic as essentials, but of enlarging
the natural instincts, i.e., character by practices not merely
by precepts.</p>

<p>The average girl (if there is such a thing as an average
girl) does not want to sit down and passively receive
theoretical instruction. She wants to be up and actually
doing things in practice, and this is a good lever to
work upon if only the teacher will recognise it as the
instrument ready to her hand.</p>

<p>Your first step then is to study the girl herself; to
recognise her likes and dislikes, her good qualities and
her bad, and to direct her training on these.</p>


<h4 class="center">How to Apply the Training</h4>

<p>The scheme given in this book is little more than a
suggestive outline. It is left to the ingenuity of the
Captain to devise generally on these lines further activities
such as will best suit her local conditions.</p>

<p>Games and practices selected or planned for the purpose
can be made to teach, through the youthful enthusiasm
of the girls, most of the moral attributes required,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
such as self-restraint, good temper, obedience to leaders
and to rules, unselfishness, pluck, moral endurance, fairness,
esprit de corps, etc., as well as physical hygiene.
Further, they teach soberness in success, good humour in
defeat, and repression of show-off and hysterics.</p>

<p>For example, if a girl faints on parade it should be a
point of honour almost to take no notice of her beyond
allowing her Corporal and one other Scout to look after
her. The business of the moment should go on as if
nothing untoward were happening.</p>



<h3>THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SCOUTER</h3>

<p>There are two fundamental points to be considered in
dealing with Scouts. The first is that the only woman
who can hope for real success as a trainer of Scouts is
the one who can be their elder sister. The “Commanding
Officer” is no good and the “Schoolmistress” is
doomed to failure (though in neither case probably would
the woman recognise it herself nor admit it). This fact
is being proved daily by the successful results already
gained by our Captain. By the term “elder sister” I
mean one who while commanding their respect can place
herself on terms of comradeship with her girls, entering
into their games and laughter, herself thereby winning
their confidence and putting herself into that position
which is essential for teaching, namely, where by her
own example she leads them in the right direction instead
of merely pointing the way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">The Psychology of the Girl</h4>

<p>The second item to recognise, although as a point it is
of first importance, is that the girl of eight to ten is psychologically
quite different from the girl of ten to fifteen.
I don’t mean that the change comes about with a bang
in the tenth year; but the younger girl is growing relatively
in mind and body more rapidly than the elder one,
and the transition gradually comes about approximately
at those ages in the average girl. The age at which
crime begins among the poorer class of children points to
the age at which character begins to form itself, and it
appears much earlier in life than is usually supposed; that
is to say, the crime returns show a good deal of juvenile
depravity at the early age of ten and eleven, and at
twelve it has mounted to its highest point in the young
generation up to twenty. Between the ages of eight and
nine, therefore, seem to be the right time to get hold of
the girl when the seeds of character may begin to sprout
into pliant tendrils ready to trail off in the wrong direction,
but easily taken in hand at that time and trained
aright.</p>

<p>Under eleven the following are common attributes in
the average child: make-believe, appreciation of fairy
tales, eagerness for new experiences, collection of stamps
and other curios, mental restlessness, physical restlessness,
thoughtlessness, untruthfulness, etc. Over eleven the
following attributes may be generally counted on: constructiveness,
hero-worship, liking for team games, dawning
conscience, sense of humour, of pathos and of sympathy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">Character</h4>

<p>In any case sense of honour, truth, self-control, fairness,
discipline, responsibility and good humour have been
too little inculcated among girls in the past, and this
important omission we endeavour to make good in the
practices and activities of the Scout work adapted to
the psychology changes as they come.</p>


<h4 class="center">The Patrol System for Scouts</h4>

<p>I remember when we first started the Boy Scout and
Girl Scout Movements in England, I received some valuable
advice from a prominent business man with regard
to organising the Headquarters Office.</p>

<p>He told me that women were far the best clerks to
employ in preference to men, but he said the pity of it
was that they only rose to a certain height in their work
and they could not be made managers of departments because
they could not take responsibility.</p>

<p>War conditions have since shown that if he meant this
as a rule he was wrong. Women have risen splendidly
to the occasion, and in very many cases have shown
themselves perfectly qualified to take higher duties upon
themselves.</p>

<p>At the same time there is no doubt that if more of them
were prepared for it early in life, many more of them
would be so employed in ordinary times of peace.</p>

<p>In the Girl Scout Movement, as in the Boy Scouts, we
also have the small unit—the Patrol—commanded by
its own girl Leader.</p>

<p>This in the first place conduces to the Patrol Spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
among its members, where each of them considers the
honour of her unit to be always at stake, and that it is
up to her among its other members constantly to uphold
its reputation.</p>

<p>This brings the development of self-discipline, sense of
duty and selflessness down to the individual. Emulation
between Patrols in a Troop make for a higher
standard of efficiency and collective discipline all round;
and this is a great help to the Captain.</p>

<p>But also there is the Patrol Leader. She is the responsible
officer for leading her Patrol to victory and
for keeping each member of the unit up to the mark
so that the Patrol as a whole does not fall behind any
other.</p>

<p>To do this effectively she soon discovers, if it is not
otherwise pointed out to her, that she has to be a Leader
not only in name but in fact and in act.</p>

<p>She has to be an all-round efficient, and she has to use
her brain and thought, her initiative and power of command
to hold and lead those under her.</p>

<p>With a little practice this rôle becomes a habit. Having
learnt how to obey and how to restrain herself she develops
the power of command and her own sense of responsibility,
thereby unconsciously preparing herself to
take higher positions of trust in real life later on.</p>

<p>But above all this means for each individual the development
of <i>character</i>. And that is our aim.</p>

<p><i>The Court of Honour</i> formed by Patrol Leaders and
their Assistants (“Corporals”) is also of untold value
in founding and developing the strength of the Scout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
spirit and the sense of responsibility to a further degree
among the girls.</p>

<p>For these reasons the Patrol System is the most important
element in the Girl Scout Training, and it is, as
far as I know, the only step so far made available towards
educating girls practically in two points which have long
been missing in their upbringing—namely, in the sense
and practice of Self-discipline and Responsibility.</p>


<h4 class="center">How the Scout Training Appeals</h4>

<p>From the parents’ point of view Scout work gives character
to the girls, also skill at handicrafts; thirdly, service
and helpfulness to others; fourthly, physical health and
development.</p>

<p>From the teacher’s point of view it provides a healthy
environment outside the school, and activities which tend
to develop in practice many of these attributes inculcated
theoretically in the girls’ lessons.</p>

<p>From the girls’ point of view Scouting puts them into
fraternity gangs among jolly comrades and it gives them
a smart dress and equipment, it appeals to their imagination
in results, and it engages them in an active open-air
and healthy life.</p>

<p>Our aim is to give equal chances to all and to give the
most help to the least fortunate.</p>

<p>The training applies equally well to girls of all classes
and can be carried out in towns just as well as in the
country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>


<h4 class="center">Camps</h4>

<p>Camping, which a few years ago was looked upon as
impossible for girls, has now become an institution in
very many centres—or one that has brought the very
best results. It is what the girls look forward to with
intense joy, and it gives the Captains their greatest opportunity.</p>

<p>Large camps are, for training purposes, a mistake:
one troop of three or four patrols is as much as a
Captain and Lieutenant can manage with due regard to
the health and training of the girls. They may be carried
out in tents or in barns and farm buildings, empty
houses, etc.</p>


<h4 class="center">Religion</h4>

<p>Two authorities from very different points of view
have gone so far as to describe Scouting and Scout work
as “a new religion and a practical one.” One of these
was a clergyman and a schoolmaster, and the other a
statesman of strong human sympathies.</p>

<p>We have not ourselves pretended to claim any such
standing for the teaching, but we do find from experience
that <i>where rightly handled</i> it can put the right spirit
and the right grounding into children for developing religion
through their inner consciousness instead of having
theology imposed upon them through surface instruction
of morality taught them through fear of punishment.</p>


<h4 class="center">Nature Study and Good Turns</h4>

<p>To interest the child is our method of training in the
Scout movement, whatever may be the subject taken up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
It can equally be used in the development of the elements
of religion without in any way trenching on the teaching
of any particular denomination—indeed it is helpful to
all.</p>

<p>We use, therefore, the study of Nature as a first step
to the realisation of the Creator. The dissection of a
plant or bird, the observation of the habits of an animal or
an insect, or the study of the stars and planets all command
the eager interest of the girl, and if properly applied,
reveal to her with absorbing force the miracle
laws of Nature; it gives her a sense of the beautiful; it
gives her an uplifting instinct of reverence for the power
of God.</p>

<p>Then, on the moral side, to <i>be</i> good is of little interest
to the child; to do good is another matter. She has an
innate predisposition to the active practice rather than
to the passive reception, and the Scout encouragement
to do the daily good turn meets her inclination and
eventually leads her—bit by bit—to the practice of
kindness and of self-sacrifice for others as her natural
habit of mind and action. In other words, the germ of
the Divine Love that is within her is developed along
lines which appeal to her, till it blossoms out as an integral
part of her life and character, as her soul. In
this way the soul is educated, that is, self-expanded from
within: it cannot be developed artificially by the application
of book instruction and rules from without.</p>

<p>Nature study should not be the mere formal class
teaching of the school, but should be the interested pursuit
of each individual girl in that branch of it which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
particularly appeals to her, through practical handling
and dealing with it.</p>

<p>Through such Nature investigation, and the consequent
appreciation of God the Creator, the Captain can
lead the girl on to a right understanding of biology and
of her own position in the order of nature; to realise how
she can be associated with the Creator in His work and
how she can have her part in the romance of reproduction
and the carrying on of the race; also that good
motherhood is a wonderful gift of God, at once a sacred
and a patriotic privilege and duty.</p>

<p>Many a girl has been ruined by ignorance on the subject,
and by the wrong or debased views picked up haphazard.
Parents to a great extent evade their duties
in this direction, and yet they are apt to resent other
people trying to remedy their neglect. So it is often desirable
for a Captain to consult the mother before talking
to a girl, but the girl should not be left to slide in ignorance.
Then it is not a thing to deal with before a number
of girls, but with the individual according to her psychology.</p>

<p>One of the objects in a Captain being “an elder sister
rather than an officer” to her girls is precisely that she
can talk to them intimately and naturally on this very
vital topic.</p>


<h4 class="center">Rallies</h4>

<p>Rallies are useful for bringing together a number of
Troops to see each other and be seen by others whom
it is desired to interest in the Movement. For either or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
both purposes it is a good thing to have displays of Scout
activities by the different patrols and companies, and
also to have competitions between them in various Scout
practices.</p>

<p>A too common fault about Rallies is that the stage-managing
is faulty—the way in which the thing is presented
is as important as the thing presented, so far as
the outside impression is concerned. The other fault
is that generally the displays are chosen too much with a
view to training the girls and too little with a view to
interesting the onlookers. This is a bad fault if you are
trying to spread the Movement and to get people keenly
interested in it. The two points can perfectly well be
combined. Let the programme err on the short side, and
let it be full of variety, novelty, incident, and interest.
Long signalling tests and bandaging exhibitions are intensely
boring to the onlookers who don’t understand
them. Whereas a realistic accident, a pretty dance, good
acting, and graceful gymnastics, and exhibitions of work
done, or girls at work, are pleasing and attractive.</p>

<p>Let it go with a snap—short, sharp and sweet.</p>

<p>Often the Rally includes inspection by a Commissioner
or other officers.</p>


<h4 class="center">Inspection of Troops by Commissioners</h4>

<p>There was in the early days of the Movement a tendency
to look upon the inspection of a Troop rather
in the light of a military parade or a social function,
when in point of fact it should be neither.</p>

<p>A cursory review by a visiting officer is bound to induce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
training for outward effect and appearance, an entire
perversion of our aims and methods.</p>

<p>I have seen it suggested, even quite recently, that the
girls in the Troop should be ranged for inspection in
order of size so that they may please the eye of the inspector!</p>

<p>The up-to-date inspecting officer is not likely to be
taken in by eye-wash. Her aim is to ascertain to what
extent results have been attained by the Captain among
the girls in each Patrol in her Troop in the four main
branches of our training.</p>


<ul class="smallin">
<li>Character and Intelligence.</li>
<li>Skill and Handicraft.</li>
<li>Service for Others.</li>
<li>Physical Health and Health Knowledge.</li></ul>

<p>She will generally take each Patrol separately, or if
there is not time for this, one Patrol selected at random
from each Troop.</p>

<p>She will then, by questioning the Patrol Leader and
some of the Scouts, judge for herself to what extent
the leader is capable of responsibility and leadership, and
to what extent the girls are efficient, keen, and smart.</p>

<p>She can, by a few simple tests, soon see whether they
have really earned their badges, and she can offer them
simple personal advice which will sink in and be valued.</p>

<p>The Scout Spirit and Scout proficiency are to her the
important points to look for.</p>

<p>Accurate drill, neat bandaging, quick and legible signalling,
smart uniform, are excellent steps, but they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
only steps among others towards the attainment of
womanly efficiency on the part of the individual girl.</p>

<p>That is the aim of our training.</p>

<p>Happy, smiling face, ready resourcefulness and quick
intelligence in carrying out any job that may be given is
the evidence of keen esprit de corps in the Patrol, are
by far the best indications to the inspecting officer as to
whether or not true Scout training is practised by the
Captain in her Troop.</p>


<h4 class="center">Give Us the Young!</h4>

<p>As Benjamin Kidd has written, let our cry be:——</p>

<p>“Oh! you wise men who would reconstruct the world!
Give us the young. Give us the young. Do what you
will with the world, only give us the young. It is the
dreams which we teach them: it is the Utopias which we
conceive for them: it is the thoughts which we think for
them, which will rebuild the world. Give us the young
before the evil has held them and we will create a new
Heaven and a new Earth.”</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
